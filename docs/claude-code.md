 After reviewing all documentation, here's my comprehensive understanding:

  Project Overview: An AI-powered chat interface for the Vachanamrut scriptures
  that provides instant spiritual guidance through natural conversation, with
  deep contextual understanding and citation capabilities.

  Key Requirements:
  - Chat Interface: Natural language conversation with AI, mobile-responsive
  design
  - Knowledge Base: Complete Vachanamrut PDF processing with accurate passage
  retrieval and citations
  - Theme Enhancement: Predefined theme mappings connecting passages to guidance
  areas
  - Mobile-First: Responsive web design optimized for mobile usage
  - Performance: <2s response time, <3s mobile load time, 99.9% uptime

  Tech Stack Planned:
  - Frontend: React 18+ with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
  - Backend: FastAPI (Python), LangChain for document processing
  - AI: OpenAI/Claude API for conversational responses
  - Vector DB: Pinecone/Weaviate for semantic search
  - Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) or SQLite for development
  - Deployment: Vercel/Netlify (frontend), Railway/Render (backend)

  Proposed Plan of Action

  Phase 1: Foundation Setup (High Priority)

  1. Project Structure: Create the monorepo structure with frontend/, backend/,
  docs/, data/, scripts/ directories
  2. Frontend Bootstrap: Initialize React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS with
   proper configuration
  3. Backend Bootstrap: Set up FastAPI with proper project structure,
  dependencies, and configuration
  4. Core Chat Components: Build the essential chat interface (MessageBubble,
  ChatInput, ChatInterface)

  Phase 2: Core Functionality (Medium Priority)

  5. PDF Processing: Implement document chunking and metadata extraction from
  Vachanamrut PDF
  6. Vector Database: Set up semantic search capabilities with embedding
  generation
  7. AI Integration: Connect to LLM service with proper prompt engineering for
  spiritual guidance
  8. Theme System: Create predefined theme mappings and contextual response
  enhancement
  9. Database Schema: Design and implement data models for documents, themes, and
   conversations

  Phase 3: Polish & Optimization (Lower Priority)

  10. Mobile Optimization: Ensure responsive design and mobile-first user
  experience
  11. Error Handling: Comprehensive error management, logging, and monitoring
  12. Development Environment: Docker setup for consistent development experience

  Key Considerations:

  - Security: No malicious code creation - this is a legitimate spiritual
  guidance application
  - Accuracy: Critical that citations and spiritual guidance are accurate and
  respectful
  - Performance: Mobile-first approach with fast loading and responsive design
  - Scalability: Architecture designed to handle growth from 100 to 10k+ users

  The plan follows the PRD requirements exactly, implements the specified tech
  stack, and adheres to the development guidelines. Each phase builds upon the
  previous one, ensuring a solid foundation before adding complexity.


Use the conceptual framework of how Claude Projects work (simple document attachment + intelligent conversation) as the design philosophy for building this companion application, but still build it as a custom web application.
