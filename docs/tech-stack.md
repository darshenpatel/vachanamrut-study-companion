# Tech Stack Overview - Vachanamrut Study Companion

## Architecture Philosophy

**Simplicity First**: Keep the stack minimal and focused to enable rapid development and easy maintenance while ensuring scalability for future growth.

## Frontend Stack

### Core Framework
- **React 18+** with TypeScript
  - Component-based architecture for reusable UI elements
  - Strong typing for better development experience
  - Excellent mobile responsiveness capabilities

### Styling & UI
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, responsive styling
  - Mobile-first approach
  - Consistent design system
  - Easy customization for spiritual/contemplative aesthetic

### State Management
- **React Context + useReducer** for app state
  - Simple, built-in solution
  - Perfect for chat history and user preferences
  - No external dependencies needed for MVP

### Build Tools
- **Vite** for fast development and building
  - Lightning-fast hot module replacement
  - Optimized production builds
  - TypeScript support out of the box

## Backend Stack

### Core Framework
- **FastAPI** (Python)
  - Automatic API documentation with Swagger
  - Excellent TypeScript integration
  - Built-in async support for AI processing
  - Simple deployment options

### AI & NLP
- **LangChain** for document processing and AI orchestration
  - PDF parsing and chunking
  - Vector database integration
  - Memory management for conversations

- **OpenAI API** or **Claude API** for conversational AI
  - High-quality responses
  - Good understanding of spiritual/philosophical content
  - Reliable API with good documentation

### Vector Database
- **Pinecone** or **Weaviate** for semantic search
  - Fast similarity search for relevant passages
  - Easy integration with LangChain
  - Scalable vector storage

### PDF Processing
- **PyMuPDF** or **LangChain DocumentLoaders**
  - Extract text while preserving structure
  - Handle various PDF formats
  - Metadata extraction for citations

## Database & Storage

### Primary Database
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL)
  - Built-in authentication if needed later
  - Real-time subscriptions
  - Easy API generation
  - Excellent developer experience

### Alternative Option
- **SQLite** with **SQLAlchemy** for simpler deployment
  - Perfect for MVP with moderate traffic
  - Easy local development
  - Simple backup and migration

## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Hosting
- **Frontend**: Vercel or Netlify
  - Automatic deployments from Git
  - Edge network for fast loading
  - Simple environment management

- **Backend**: Railway, Render, or DigitalOcean App Platform
  - Easy Python deployment
  - Auto-scaling capabilities
  - Integrated database options

### Environment Management
- **Docker** for consistent development environments
- **Environment variables** for API keys and configuration
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline

## Development Tools

### Code Quality
- **ESLint + Prettier** for consistent code formatting
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Pytest** for backend testing
- **React Testing Library** for frontend testing

### Documentation
- **Storybook** for component documentation (optional)
- **FastAPI** automatic API docs
- **README** files for setup and deployment

## Security Considerations

### API Security
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- API key management for external services
- Input validation and sanitization

### Data Privacy
- No user data storage initially (stateless)
- Secure handling of chat conversations
- Compliance with data protection standards

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend
- Code splitting for faster initial loads
- Image optimization
- Service worker for offline capabilities (future)

### Backend
- Response caching for common queries
- Async processing for AI requests
- Database query optimization

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Basic Tracking
- **Vercel Analytics** or **Google Analytics** for usage metrics
- **Sentry** for error tracking
- **Uptime monitoring** for reliability

### Application Metrics
- Response times
- User engagement patterns
- API usage statistics

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. Docker Compose for full stack development
2. Hot reloading for both frontend and backend
3. Shared environment configuration

### Version Control
- **Git** with feature branch workflow
- **Conventional commits** for clear history
- **Pull request** reviews for code quality

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for utility functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows

## Scalability Considerations

### Current Architecture Benefits
- Stateless backend design
- Microservice-ready API structure
- Database designed for growth
- CDN-ready frontend assets

### Future Scaling Options
- Horizontal scaling of API servers
- Read replicas for database
- Caching layer with Redis
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes

## Cost Optimization

### MVP Phase
- Free tiers of cloud services
- Minimal external API usage
- Efficient resource utilization

### Growth Phase
- Usage-based scaling
- Cost monitoring and alerts
- Optimization based on actual usage patterns

This tech stack provides a solid foundation for rapid development while maintaining the flexibility to scale and add features as the platform grows.
