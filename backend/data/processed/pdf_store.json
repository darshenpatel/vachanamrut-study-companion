He initiated 500 sa'dhus who, in addition to renouncing both women and wealth, abided by the five vows of nonlust, non-avarice, non-taste, non-attachment and non-egotism. So that u p k ~ nrelm ains eternally on earth, He built mandim. Also, He instructed Pujya Muktanand SwGmi and other sZdhus to author scriptures narrating the life of their ishtadev, Bhagwan SwlrninHrlyan Himself. So, in order to strengthen the faith and conviction of thousands of aspirants and allow them to attain ultimate liberation, the s5dhus authored scriptures. is 'amrut' in the form of the words of Bhagwan Sw&niniirGyan. The teachings and principles uttered by Bhagwan SwHmi-narlyan in assemblies at Gadhadl, Siirangpur, GriyHni, Loyl, Panchlll, Vartll, AmdEwld and other places had been compiled by the szdhus so that aI1 can partake of that 'amrut'. From that compilation they created a thorough scripture; and 'amrut' in the form of those words is the Vachaniirnrut, which all devotees read daily. From the VachanBmrut, one realises atmai- Pararniitml, Brahma-Parabrahma, Akshar-Purushottam, Swami- Niirlyan. That is, one identifies one's self with Akshar and worships Purushottam, thereby attaining the eternal, lustrous and divine Akshardhlm of Purushottam Nlrlyan. Also, dharma, gnan, vairsgya and bhakticoupled with the knowledge of the glory of God - that is, ekhtik dharma - are strengthened. One becomes free from desires and free from the influences of mlyz, thus eternally remaining in the service of Mahlrlj. One also attains eternal bliss. Such is the tremendous glory of the Vachanamrut. Its words are the divine words of BhagwPn SwlrninHrayan. It is the essence of all scriptures. It serves to uplift, benefit and liberate all people. Previously, Shri Harshadbhai T. Dave had translated this glorious and liberating Vachanamrut into English so that all those living both in India and abroad benefit. And now, a team of szdhus has re-translated the scripture. After all, in this day and age, only",

Each Vachanamrut begins with an introductory paragraph taking the reader back in time to the exact environment in which the discourses were held, thereby mentally preparing him for the profound wisdom that is to come. The compilers meticulously - and - ingeniously detailed all of the major aspects of the setting of the assembly, even at the risk of sounding repetitive. Invariably, they mention the date, the month, the year, the village, the location within the village, as well as the audience seated in the assembly. In many instances, they even mention the time of day and the direction in which Bhagwan Swiiminiiriiyan was seated. In many instances, they have even described the seat upon which He was seated as well as the dress and adornment of Bhagwiin Swiiminiir5yan at the time. Primarily, the reason for their meticulousness was that they were convinced of His divinity. They understood that the assembly was not an ordinary, worldly assembly of people, but a divine assembly presided over by the Supreme God Himself. After all, much more than anything else, divinity is worthy of being recalled perfectly. From a scholarly point of view, this introductory paragraph adds a stamp of authenticity to the scripture. In the words of an eminent GujarBti.

Thus, there isn o room for interpolation. \" If the introductory paragraph of the Vachanamrut renders the scripture unique, the method of imparting spiritual wisdom is no less unique. Instead of opting for a monologue, preaching style, Bhagwfin SwfiminIriiyan delivered His discourses in the &rm of a dialoguemuch like the method used by the sages in the Upanishads. At times, Bhagwan Swaminiirfiyan would pose a question to the members of the assembly, or sometimes He would ask the assembly to pose a question to Him. On other occasions, members of the assembIy would ask a question directly. In His assemblies, all were free to question and even to counter-question, regardless of whether they were scholarly renunciants or ordinary householders. Keeping in mind this question-answer method and the fact that many of the members of the assemblies were great scholars themselves, one can imagine the thoroughness of Bhagwiin Sw6miniirfipan's knowledge on the subjects discussed. The issues raised in the Vachanfimrut are quite varied, ranging from deeply philosophical and theological subjects, such as the nature of God, creation of the cosmos, clarifications of the cIassica1 Hindu philosophies of Echfiryas such as Shankar, Rlmiinuj, Vallabh and others; to more spiritually practical subjects such as the liberation of the soul, good and bad company, as well as the means of attaining eternal happiness. Since the topics discussed have no relation to the ordering of the Vachanfifirut, the reader need not read the scripture sequentially. Regardless of the subject, though, Bhagwan SwHminlr5yan had the gift of lucidly and elegantly explaining complex concepts through simple day-to-day examples. In fact, even the villagers sitting in the assembly were able to grasp profound philosophical concepts due to His simple language and meaningful examples. is also an authoritative scripture in as much as it was spoken by God Himself and written down at the same time. In fact, it was even reviewed and approved by Bhagwiin Swaminfiriiyan during its compilation, a fact evident in Vachanamrut Loyl-7.

Besides the fact that the words were spoken by the supreme Reality Himself, Bhagwan Swiiminlriiyan had studied the scriptures thoroughly, had mastered Ashtiing-Yoga and had also scrutinized the beliefs and practices of people throughout India. Thus, when He spoke, it was from a base of profound scriptural wisdom, advanced spiritual insight and vast practical experience.

This challenging task was achieved through the diligent and meticulous efforts of Shri H. Dave, who was continually inspired and guided by Yogiji MahlrFij and Pramukh Swami MahlrIj. He worked from the original Gujarlti text published by Swaminlrlyan Aksharpith, which itself is a letter-to-letter, printed version of the original, authentic manuscript published in 1928 under the auspices of Achlrya Shripatiprasldji of Vartll. This second English edition of the Vachanamrut is a completely new, revised translation made by a team of sgdhus from the original Gujarlti text published by Swaminlrlyan Aksharpith. The work of translation began in September 1996 with initial meetings to discuss methods and conventions, and concluded in September 2001 with blessings from His Divine Holiness Pramukh Swami Mahlrlj, who continually supplied invaluable inspiration to complete the monumental task. The reader will find that before beginning the text, understanding the approach and the conventions adopted in the translation will undoubtedly provide a deeper insight into the text, as well as a clearer understanding of why it has been translated as it has. The Challenges Unlike other books, translating the Vachanamrut into English posed many challenges. The first challenge was its mere size - the original GujarIti scripture was colossal - it contained 657 printed pages! Most importantly, though, it was to be treated as a holy scripture. Unlike other descriptive books and novels where certain imaginative aspects could be superimposed, in the case of this translation, nothing was to be added and nothing was to be removed. After all, the act of creation was already complete; it was to be merely translated. However, unlike translating text from German to English or from French to English, the task. at hand required translating Gujariiti to English - two very distant languages, both syntactically",

      "content": "linking words for better flow. Although this sentence-by-sentence method may sound simplistic or crude, its prime benefit was that it assured accuracy. After all, years from now, people should not say, 'This was not in the original!\" or \"This has been omitted for some reason!\"o, a helpful by-product of this methodology was that it could tremendously help those who are referring to the original Gujarlti VachanBmrut. With this method, most extracted. quotations from the original GujarBti text that are used in other books could immediately be correlated to corresponding sentences in the English translation. Another issue in maintaining accuracy was retaining certain Gujariiti or Sanskrit words in their original form. It is a wellknown and accepted fact that certain concepts in the Vachanimrut simply have no equivalent English words. For example, 'anvaj and 'ryati~Kh ave no exact, simple, English equivalent words or phrases. 'Manushyabha'rf can only be rendered into English by using a phrase - a single word simply does not suffice. In these cases, instead of repeatedly using a lengthy English phrase or an inaccurate approximation, the original GujarLti or Sanskrit word was kept with the appropriate English spelling. In general, these words fall into three categories: 1) Words that cannot be translatedmostly proper nouns and technical, philosophical terms such as 'anvay,' 'vyatirek,' 'ekzntik,. ' 'Prakruti,' 'Aksharbrahma,' etc. 2) Words that can be translated but have many subtle shades in Gujargti that are lost in English. For example, 'darshan' could be translated as 'to see, or to look at', but in reality to do 'darshan' has much more meaning than just looking at someone; it incorporates an attitude and devotional intentions that are much more than simply looking at someone, or even looking at someone with reverence. 3) Words that can be translated into English fairly accurately but which the reader should learn in GujarBti nonetheless. For example, 'gnGn'could be translated to 'knowledge'; but, the word 'gnan'merits a place in the reader's vocabulary because it is so vital a concept in the Vachanamrut. Throughout the translation process, the translators continually fine-tuned this list by adding and removing words",

      "content": "XVI S~ellinsC onventions A major decision that had to be made regarding this list of Gujarati and Sanskrit words was the convention to be used for spelling. Ideally, diacritical marks provide an exact rendering of such words to English; but, to make the words more easily readable to a wider audience, a simpler scheme was chosen. Overall, the general criteria for determining spellings of Gujarlti words was pronunciation - words were spelled as pronounced (e. , 'Arjun', not 'Arjuna'). Many times Sanskrit spellings of words differ from the pronunciation of words (e. Even in such cases, pronunciation was the primary criteria. Of course, in cases that could have caused confusion (e. , using 'gun' for 'guna' could cause confusion), or if a different spelling was already well-established (e. , 'Gitl' is in use everywhere, not the technically correct 'Geeta'), the general rule of using pronunciation as the key was overridden. Also, if a particular word was already in the English dictionary and if the definition therein matched the connotation of that word in the Vachanamrut (e. , puja, guru, etc. ) then the English spelling of that word was used, and the word was not italicised. One problem with making pronunciation the basis for the spelling of Gujarlti words was that some sounds in the Gujarlti language could not be accurately represented by the English alphabet. For this reason, one diacritical mark was eventually used in the spelling conventions for Gujarlti words. To differentiate between the 'a' sound in words like 'about' and the Sanskrit-Gujarlti prolonged ' a 9 sound - as in 'vaasanaa,' 'sevaa,' or father - the letter '2' was used ('vZsanZ'and 'sevzj, pronounced as in 'art' or 'car'. Although this spelling scheme does have drawbacks, such as its inability to differentiate between letters such as '6' and 'Q', both of which are transliterated as 'tha', and between letters such as '21' and 'V', transliterated as 'sha', in most cases words can be pronounced relatively easily. The scheme avoids forcing the reader to learn a complex system of diacritical marks, and in most cases, the words are pronounced exactly as they are spelled. Furthermore, the spellings of all English words follow the U. English spelling conventions - thus the spelling 'colour' instead of 'coIor'",

By the age of 10, He had acquired such mastery over the Vedic scriptures that in a scholarly debate in Gshi He defeated learned scholars many times His age with His brilliant scriptural arguments. At the age of 11, He renounced home to embark on a 7- year spiritual sojourn on foot across the length and breadth of India. After performing intense austerities in the Himalayas, He arrived in the forests of Nepal where He mastered Ashting-Yoga from Gopiil Yogi in approximately one year, at the age of 14. When He eventually settled in GujarHt, where He spent the last 30 years of His life spearheading a socio-spiritual revolution, the breadth of His scriptural knowledge and the depth of His spiritual experience shone through in all of His activities. With a faithful following of 500 paramhansas, renunciants of the highest order, He established the SwiiminirByan Sampradiy, introducing much needed social reforms, serving the poor and the needy, and challenging superstitions, addictions and blind faith. Also known as Sahajinand Swami and Shriji MahHriij, He focused on promoting morality and moulding spiritual character. In a lifespan of only years, He enriched humanity by building six majestic mandirs and revealed the Vedic philosophy of worship of Purushottam along with His foremost devotee, Akshar. To reveal this and other important principles of spirituality, He delivered discourses wherever He went. The profound wisdom imparted by Him has been meticulously captured in what is the most fundamental scripture of the Swiimin5riyan Sampradiiy - the Vachanamrut. What is unique about His life was that, first, He was worshipped as the Supreme God by hundreds of thousands of devotees. Secondly, in addition to profoundly enriching society during His own lifetime, He promised to remain ever-present on earth through a succession of spiritual gurus. Thus, His presence was maintained by Guniititinand Swimi, the incarnation of Akshar. He, in turn, was succeeded by Bhagatji MahBrkj, Shlstriji Maharaj, Yogiji Mahliriij and presently by Pragat Brahmaswarup Pramukh Swami Mahiirlj. The bhakti-sampradly Bhagwan Swaminlriiyan founded in His time has thus emerged as one of the purest and most progressive forms of Hinduism, internationally known as. the BAPS Swimink-lyan Sansthl",

He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of sidhus as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him. Thereupon Shriji Mahiriij asked, \"Which is the most difficult of all spiritual endeavours. \" The brahmachzris, szdhus and householders answered according to their own understanding, but none could give a satisfactory reply, Shriji Mahlrgj then said, \"Allow Me to answer. There is no spiritual endeavour more difficult than to continuously engage one's mind on the form of God. The scriptures state that there is no greater attainment for a person whose mind's vrutti is constantly focused on the form of God, because the form of God is like a chintiimani. Just as a person who possesses a chintimani attains whatever he desires, a person whose mind's vrutti is constantly focused on the form of God can instantly see, if he so wishes, the forms of jiva, ishwar, miyi and Brahma. He can also see Vaikunth, Golok, Brahmamahol and the other abodes of God. Therefore, there is no spiritual endeavour more difficult nor is there any greater attainment than to continuously engage one's mind on the form of God. \" Thereafter, the devotee Govardhanbhii Sheth asked Shriji Mahiriij, 'What is the nature of God's miy,. , Shriji MahlrIj replied, \"Miyi is anything that obstructs a devotee of God while meditating on God's form.",

When such devotees leave their body and go to the abode of God, some go by sitting on Garud, some go by sitting on a chariot and some go by sitting on a celestial vehicle. This is how they reach the abode of God.

What is the reason for this. \" lo Shriji Mahlrij explained, \"Such a person has not fully realised the greatness of God. Consequently, when the Santby whose association God's greatness is fully realised - talks to him about his swabhlvs, the person is not able to overcome them. Instead, he bears an aversion towards the Sant. It is due to this sin that he does not develop intense love for the Satsang fellowship.

But, like King Janak, he is not affected by those activities. He may indulge in the most alluring of the panchvishayssights, - sounds, smells, tastes and touch attained as a consequence of his own prirabdha, but he does so dejectedly and with total indifference towards them. Those vishays are unable to entice him; thus, his renunciation remains undiminished. He invariably views those vishays as flawed and treats them like enemies. Moreover, he constantly remains in contact with szdhus and the sacred scriptures, and remains in the service of God. Even if he were to encounter adverse places, times, company, etc. 1, his understanding would not diminish. Such a person is said to possess the highest level of vairigya. 4 \"A person who has an intermediate level of vairigya also indulges in the best of the panchvishays and remains unattracted to them. But, if he were to encounter adverse places, times, company, etc. , he would become attached to those vishays. Consequently, his level of vairiigya would diminish.

Seeing this, NBradji became jealous of Tumbaru, and thought, 'X shall also learn to sing like Tumbaru and please God. ' J \"Then, Niiradji learned the art of singing and sang before God. But God commented, You do not know how to sing Iike Tumbaru. ' Thereafter, NIradji performed austerities to please Shiv and received his blessings to master the art of singing. However, when he sang before God again, God was still not pleased. In this way, Niradji continued for seven manvantars. Despite this, God would not be pleased with his singing. 6 \"Finally, Nlradji learned to sing from Tumbaru himself and then sang before Shri Krishna Bhagwan in Dwirikl. Only then was Shri Krishna Bhagwan pleased, and only then did he reward NIradji with his own clothes and ornaments. Thereafter, Nlradji abandoned his jealousy towards Tumbaru. 7 \"Thus, if one is to harbour jealousy, one should imbibe the virtues of the person towards whom one is jealous, and should also abandon one's own faults. If this cannot be done, then a devotee of God should at least totally abandon any form of jealousy that would result in harming another devotee of God. \" Vachanamrut Gadhadl 1-4.",

Of these, from sittvik-ahamkir, the man and the presiding deities of the indriyas evolved; from rijas-ahamkiq the ten indriyas, the buddhi and the prins evolved; and from timas-ahamkir, the five bhuts and the five tanma'tris evolved. In this way, all of those elements were produced. 28 \"Then, inspired by God's will, each element, with its own constituents, helped create the bodies of the ishwars and the jivas. A particular ishwar's bodies are known as vikit, sutritmi and avyikrut; and a particular jiva's bodies are known as sthul, sukshma and ka'ran. 29 'The body of the ishwar called Virit has a lifespan of two parzrdhs. Fourteen manvantars elapse during one of Virit- Purush's days. His night is of the same duration as the day.

Thus, he said, \"Mahiirlj, please answer the question Yourself. \" Thereupon Shriji Mahiriij said, \"If a renunciant who is weak-minded receives rich foods to eat, then desires for worldly life will be revived within his heart. Or, if he encounters many hardships, again, desires for worldly life will be revived. Compared to such a renunciant, a householder is much better, because whenever a householder encounters times of extreme hardship or even times of great pleasure, he is always cautious lest he becomes attached to these pleasures. With this awareness, he remains disinterested in worldly life. Therefore, a true renunciant is one who has no desires for worldly life having once renounced it. 7 \"Keep in mind, though, that a householder is much better than a renunciant with worldly desires, provided he observes the dharma prescribed for householders. The householders' dharma, however, is extremely difficult to observe, because countless occasions of good and bad times are encountered. Despite this, a true householder's mind does not waver from serving the Sant or from observing his dharma. He also realises, 'The profound association of the Sant that I have attained is like a magnificent chinthani and a kalpavruksh. My wealth, property, sons and daughters are all merely like a dream, whereas the profound association of the Sant that I have attained is the only true benefit of life. ' Moreover, he remains undeterred amidst any type of adversity that may come his way. Such a householder is by far the better of the two. Therefore, of all things, becoming a devotee of God is very difficult.

If this is so, what is the significance of the bhakti one has performed throughout one's life. \" lo Shriji MahBriij explained, \"A person who has been graced with the attainment of the manifest form of God never falls from the path of liberation, regardless of whether he remembers God at the time of death. God invariably protects him. 11 \"Conversely, a person who has turned away from God does not attain liberation even if he dies normally, while being conscious. Instead, he is consigned to Yampuri after death. Many sinful butchers die while still fully conscious. But if a devotee of God suffers an untimely death, does that mean he will not attain liberation. Moreover, will that sinner attain liberation. Therefore, that Vedic verse should be interpreted as follows: 'The outcome at the time of death is determined by the present state of the mind. ' Thus, a devotee who realises in his mind, 'My liberation is guaranteed,' will, as a result, certainly attain liberation after death. In comparison, a person who has not been graced with the attainment of the Sant or the form of God will feel in his mind, 'I am ignorant, and I will not attain liberation. ' As a result, his state of mind will determine his fate after death. 12 \"Furthermore, a person who is a servant of God has nothing left to do. In fact, other jvas attain liberation by his darshan, so what is surprising about he himself attaining liberation. But to cultivate servitude towards God is very difficult indeed. Because a servant of God has the following characteristics: He realises the physical body is Ante yi matihi sigatihi Whatever one's mental state is like at the time of one's death, such will be the state of one's jivo after one's death.

Of the many varieties of foods that a person eats, each has differing tastes and differing intrinsic qualities. When he eats that food, the intrinsic qualities of the food pervade and affect the antahkaran as well as the entire body. For example, if someone drinks bhang, then even if he is a devotee of God, he loses awareness of his religious vows and the worship of God due to the stimulation caused by that bhang. Similarly, the intrinsic qualities of the countless types of food are, like bhang, of a countless variety. So much so, that they seem endless. 6 \"In the same way, a person also hears a countless variety of sounds with his ears. Those sounds also have a countless variety of intrinsic qualities. Consequently, the qualities of whatever sounds he listens to pervade and affect his antahkaran. For example, there may be an armed and violent person, an adulterous person, a prostitute, or a person who transgresses the rules of the Vedas and society. Listening to the talks of such vicious persons is like drinking bhang or alcohol; i. , such talks pollute the antahkaran of the listener and make him forget the worship of God as well as his religious vows. 7 \"Similarly, there are countless varieties of touch sensations. They too have countless varieties of intrinsic qualities. The touch of a sinful person also has an effect like that of bhang and alcohol. Therefore, even if a devotee were to touch such a person, that devotee would lose all of his virtues. 8 \"There are also countless varieties of things to see. They too have countless varieties of intrinsic qualities. If one looks at an immoral person, the effect is just as detrimental as drinking bhang or alcohol, i. e, looking at an immoral person certainly does pollute one's mind and cause harm. 9 \"In the same way, there are countless varieties of smells, with countless varieties of intrinsic qualities.

A fool, however, cannot realise this. Indeed, this fact will not be understood by those who behave irresponsibly like animals. In comparison, one who has even a little wisdom and has sought at least some refuge in God will immediately understand.

For example, if a person's finger is bitten by a snake, or if it develops gangrene, and if the affected part is immediately removed, then the rest of the body remains healthy.

When I look at someone affectionately, or eat the tasty meals they have prepared, or sit on a decorated cot arranged by them, or accept from them clothes, ornaments, garlands of flowers and other - offerings it is all for the good of their fiva, but not for the sake of My personal enjoyment. In fact, I swear by the name of Rlm5nand Swami that I do not accept those objects for My personal pleasure. Therefore, realising this, none of you should imitate Me. \"Also, keep the activities of your five indriyas extremely pure. Please accept this command of Mine without fail. This fact is simple in that it is comprehensible to all; so all of you wiIl immediately understand it. Moreover, if you extensively propagate it throughout Satsang, I shall be very pleased indeed.",

Such favour results in the attainment of the desirable and great divine power of not being overpowered by the gunas of mIyI. If, on the other hand, one does have love for God, but has not attained Itmii-realisation, then due to the belief that oneself is the body, that love cannot be perfected. One may have both the virtue of Ztmbrealisation and love for God, but if one lacks firm vairigya, then the desires for worldly vishays will prevent the perfection of stmi-realisation and love for God.

For this reason, it is the most ignorant of the ignorant, the most senseless of the senseless, the most foolish of fools and the vilest of the vile. \" At that point, Shuk Muni raised a doubt.

In fact, when has he attempted to see his own self and failed to see it. Having become dependent to and made helpless by mZyZ, that jiva draws within and enters the dream and deep sleep states, but never does it draw within of its own accord to see its own self. On the other hand, one who contemplates on the greatness of God and draws within oneself sees one's own self as extremely pure and luminous.

Nor should one's bodily relations be regarded as one's true relations. This is because the jiva has previously taken birth in each of the 8. 4 million life form@. In fact, the jiva has taken birth in the wombs of all females in this world; it has also taken birth numerous times in the wombs of all of the dogs, cats, monkeys and other types of life forms in the cycle of 8. 4 million life forms. Moreover, of all the different types of females in this world, which has it not previously made its wife? All have been its wife at one time or another.

Hence, just as one does not believe the relations of those previous 8. 4 million life forms to be one's true relations, and just as one does not believe the bodies of those 8. 4 million life forms to be one's true body, similarly, one should not believe this present body to be one's true self, nor should one believe the relations of this body to be one's true relations.

We have no desire for the temporary and vain worldly pleasures; nor do we wish to be tempted by them in any way.

On the other hand, if the chitt focuses on God after becoming free of worldly desires, then the prIns are controlled by control of the chitt. Therefore, just as the chitt is controlled by mastering ashtzng-yoga, similarly, the chitt can also be controlled by focusing on the form of God. A devotee whose chitt's vrutti becomes focused on the form of God masters ashta'ng-yoga.",

Thus, a person who is attracted to an equal extent by the words of God and His Sant, and by worldly speech should forsake such foolishness. Having forsaken such foolishness, he should experience happiness through sounds and speech related only to God. Such a person is a genuine amorous devotee. 5 \"Furthermore, just as that devotee wishes for sounds related only to God, he desires the touch only of God. When he realises other types of touch to be Iike touching a black cobra or a blazing fire, then he is a genuine amorous devotee. Similarly, if a person experiences profound bliss on seeing God, realising everything else to be like a pile of filth or a decomposed dog, then he is a genuine amorous devotee. Similarly, if a person experiences profound bliss on tasting the prasi7d of God, not enjoying the various other types of tastes, then he is a genuine amorous devotee. Furthermore, such a devotee experiences profound bliss on smelling tulsi, garlands of flowers, sandalwood paste, the many varieties of fragrant perfumes, etc. , that have been offered to God. He is not pleased on smelling the perfume, sandalwood paste, or garlands of flowers worn by materialistic people.

Therefore, such amorousness and mode of worship should be forsaken. Because it is not God who is at fault; it is the amorous devotee's attitude that is at fault; i. , he has believed God to be exactly like other objects. As a result, his bhaktiand amorousness are flawed. 7 \"Now, just as I have described discretion in indulging in the five types of vishays for the sthul body in the waking state, similarly, subtle vishays exist for the sukshma body in the dream state. A devotee may experience happiness from Godrelated sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touch on seeing the form of God in his dream, but if he also derives exactly the same pleasure on seeing other vishays in his dream, then that devotee's amorousness is false. If, on the other hand, a person in his dream experiences happiness only by association with God and feels an aversion for other vishays as if they were vomited food, then he can be said to be a genuine amorous devotee. If he does not experience this, then although the form of God seen in his dream is true, that devotee's understanding is flawed. Because he has equal love for God and for other vishays. Thus, true understanding is to remain attracted only towards the form of God, and not towards other vishays. 8 \"In this way, when only thoughts of God remain while contemplating, a state of void is attained wherein, with the exception of the form of God, that devotee does not perceive the body or the brahmind at all.

Thoughts occurring when tamogun is predominant induce a state similar to that of deep sleep. Therefore those thoughts do not leave a lasting impression in the mind. When sattvagun prevails, one experiences a state of awareness; so, any disturbing thoughts that occur at that time are dispelled by contemplation. Therefore, those thoughts do not leave a lasting impression either. However, thoughts that arise when rajogun is prevalent do leave a lasting impression in the mind. Therefore, the reason some thoughts do leave a lasting impression in the mind and others do not is due to the prevalence of the various gunas. 6 \"If an intelligent person reflects on this matter and examines his thoughts whenever they arise, he will be able to recognise which guna is predominant in him at that particular time. However, subtle thoughts that arise repeatedly from moment to moment cannot be grasped by anyone. At the most, someone intelligent like yourself may be able to discern two, three, or four of the more superficial thoughts that arise during the course of a day. 6 \"So, if a person examines the predominant guna under whose influence his thoughts arise and contemplates on and imbibes the spiritual discourses which take place in Satsang, then the power of practising satsangis such that any disturbing thoughts arising under the influence of the gunas are dispelled. Thereafter, becoming free from all doubts, he is able to continuously concentrate on the form of God. Without satsang, however, even if he endeavours in a million other ways, disturbing thoughts and the influence of rajogun and the other gunas will not be eradicated. Therefore, if someone sincerely practises satsang and reflects upon and tries to imbibe the discourses relating to God, then his vile thoughts are eradicated. In this manner, the influence of satsang is extremely powerful. In fact, no other spiritual endeavour can compare with satsang Why. Because thoughts which cannot be eradicated by any other spiritual endeavour can be removed by engaging in satsang. Therefore, one who wishes to rid the.",

If a person has intense blind faith, then even if someone such as Brahml were to attempt to deflect him from his refuge, hswould not be deflected. 5 \"The second type is firm refuge of God that is cultivated out of love. Even if a person possessing profound love for God forces himself, he does not become attracted to any object other than God. This is known as firm refuge produced out of profound love. 6 'The third type is with understanding. A person who has profound intelligence understands the sagun-nirguna nd anvayvyatimk aspects of God. He understands the entities that have been created by God's miyi, as well as the ways of God's avatirs on earth. He also understands how, at the time of the creationof the cosmos, God behaves as Akshar, how God behaves as Prakruti-Purush, how God behaves as Viriit-Purush, and how God behaves as Brahml and other prajzpatis. He also comprehends how God works through NErad, the Sanakldik and others for the purpose of granting liberation to the jivas. He understands all these methods. Moreover, he realises that Purushottam Bhagwiin transcends everything and is absolutely unaffected. He who has such an insight is said to have a firm refuge of God using his intelligence. If someone tries to dissuade him, or even if he tries to dissuade himself, such a refuge never diminishes.

Similarly, those great muktas who have attained ninikalp samidhi see jivas, ishwars and mayti as being one with Brahma -but they do not see them as distinct entities. 5 \"In this way, there are two differing states of muktas, and it is due to their differing states that everything is viewed as being either satya or asatya. The words of those who have attained the savikalp state are noted in the Vedas, the Shhstras, the Puranas, etc. , and they describe all of those entities as being satya. However, the words of those who have attained the nirvikalp state describe all of those entities as being asatya. In reality, however, they are not asatya. They ' are only described as being asatya because they cannot be seen due to the influence of the nirvikalp state. 6 \"For example, there is no night for a person sitting in the chariot of Surya; but for those on earth, there is both day and night. Similarly, from the viewpoint of a person who has. attained the nikvikalp state, all of those things do not exist, whereas according to others, they do exist. So, if one interprets 'Brahma' in this manner, then there will never be any contextual inconsistencies in the statements of the scriptures; but if one does not, then inconsistencies will arlse. Furthermore, if a person, without having understood these inconsistencies and without having attained that nirvikalp state, relying solely on words learned from the scriptures, propound the existence of Brahma alone, claiming that the guru, the disciple, jivas, ishwars, mayti, the world, the Vedas, the PurZns, the Shhstras are all imaginary, then he is extremely foolish. Ultimately, such a person will be consigned to narak. \" Having answered the question, Shriji Maharaj ended by asking the Bra'hmin, \"Now, if you have any doubts in what I have just said, please say so",

In fact, even huge mountains on either shoreline cannot be seen, so how can trees or people possibly be seen. Wherever one looks, only water can be seen; but besides water, nothing else is visible. If one looks up, the enormous waves of the ocean rising up will be seen; so even above, only water is visible. In this situation, people sitting in the ship would claim, 'There is only water; nothing else exists. ' The principle behind this example is that one who has attained a nirvikalp state in the form of Brahma claims, 'There is only Brahma; besides that, everything else, such as jivas, ishwars, miya', etc. ' Hearing words written in the scriptures supporting this view, a person who has not even attained that state claims all moral do's and don'ts to be false. On the one hand, he cares for his wife, attends to his children, and meticulously performs all worldly activities, believing them to be real; yet, on the other hand, he falsifies these do's and don'ts which have been prescribed by the scriptures.

In fact, the story of Jadbharat has been noted in each of the PurHns and all the Vediinta scriptures. That great Jadbharat was also the son of Rushabhdev Bhagwiin in his previous life. Renouncing his kingdom, he went to live in the forest. There, he developed affection for a deer; although that was merely out of compassion, this mistake caused him to be reborn as a deer. Like the deer, then, he attained a form with four legs, a short tail and small horns on his head. 7 \"In comparison, the gopis of Vraj were attached to Paramatma Shri Krishna Bhagwan out of lust. Despite this, they were still able to overcome God's may5 and attain the nirgun Akshardhim of God after becoming gunztit. The reason for this was that Shri Krishna Bhagwiin himself was Purushottam; he was gunitit and his form was divine. So, because the gopis developed affection for him, either knowingly or unknowingly, they became gunitit as well; whereas Bharatji became a deer, even though he had developed affection for the deer out of compassion. Therefore, no matter how great one may be, worldly influence only leads to harm. Conversely, regardIess of how grave a sinner a person may be, if he - - maintains profound association with God who is satya then that person also becomes absolutely pure and attains liberation. Of course, if Shri Krishna Bhagw5n was not guntitit himself, then his devotees, the gopis, would not have attained the gunztit state. But because they did attain the gunitit state, Shri Krishna Bhagwiin was most certainly flawless, gundtit and divine. 8 'Vediintis also claim, 'Everything is pervaded by Brahma. ' But just as the gopis developed affection for Shri Krishna, similarly, all women develop affection for their husbands, and all men develop affection for their wives. But they do not attain what the gopis attained; instead, they attain dismal narak. Therefore, the prescribed moral do's and don'ts are indeed true, not false.

Moreover, despite the fact that Purushottam Bhagwan's brahmarup light, which pervades all jivas and ishwars as their antaryimi, is formless, it should be considered to possess a form.

This power of governing makes it function as if it possesses a form. Thus, that divine light should be considered to possess a form as well.

Of these, the devotee possessing gnin is described as being the best. However, supposing that all four have an equal level of faith in God's form, how is the one with gnin superior. \" The munis attempted to answer the question but were unable to do so satisfactorily. Shriji Maharaj then explained, \"The devotee possessing gnin behaves as brahmaswarup and thoroughly realises the greatness of God. As a result, no desires remain in his mind except for those of God's form. The other three types of devotees, however, do not fully realise the greatness of God, despite having faith in God. Thus, desires other than those for God still persist. That is why they do not come to par with the devotee possessing gnin. Therefore, if any desires other than those related to God remain in a devotee, it is a serious flaw. 5 \"Another major flaw is when a person who has no worldly desires at all and has intense vairigva behaves arrogantly on account of that vairigya. He may have the intense force of knowledge of the itmi or have the force of resolute bhakti towards God, but if, out of arrogance, he is unable to bow before meek devotees or is unable to address them humbly, then that is also a serious flaw in him. As a result of that flaw, his inclination does not flourish. 6 \"Consider the analogy of a stone-cutter digging a well. If the stone underneath sounds hollow when he strikes it, he predicts, 'There will be plenty of water in this well. ' But, if the stone sounds solid on the surface, and sparks fly when he strikes it, then the stone-cutter infers, 'If there is going to be any water in this well at all, there will be very little. ' In the same way, a person who remains arrogant due to the vanity of his gnin, vairigya and bhaktj may be called great, but his The four types of devotees described in the Giti (7. 17) are: (1) Prta -one who is distressed from having fallen from the path of attaining yogic powers, - and thus still wishes to attain them; (2) jign-iis u one who aeeks knowledge of the itmi, i. gtmBrealisation; (3) arthPrthi one who desires material objects, i. material pleasures and powers; and (4) gnini - one who has gnin.",

As a result, the incarnate. form of Shri KrishnanHrHyan will become pleased and will reside in the heart of that person. \" Muktanand SwHmi then asked, \"MahSrHj, by what method can a person overcome the vanity which arises due to gna'n, vaira'gva, bhakti, and other noble virtues. \" Shriji MahirHj replied, \"If, while realising the greatness of B God's devotees, he physically bows down to them, serves them menially, recognises thoughts of vanity when they arise in his heart and maintains the force of thought, then vanity is eradicated. \" Shriji Mahlrlj then continued, \"A devotee's profound, loving bhakti may be so intense that due to that bhakti, God does as that devotee wishes. However, if that devotee develops vanity in his heart due to that bhakti, it constitutes a serious flaw on his part.

Therefore, devotees of God should not harbour any form of vanity whatsoever. That is the only means to please God. \"Furthermore, if introspective devotees of God examine themselves and look inwards towards their own hearts, when even a little vanity arises, they would notice an expression of disgust on the form of God residing within their hearts. Conversely, when they behave humbly, God's form residing within their hearts would appear to have an extremely pleased expression. Therefore, using the force of thought, a devotee of God should not allow any sort of vanity to arise. 11 \"If, however, vanity does co-exist with gnin, vaikjgya and bhakti, it is rather like impurities.

However, because the pruthvi floats on jal Iike a dung cake, jal appears to be much stronger than pruthn: Likewise, tej appears to be much stronger than jal, and vZyu appears to be even stronger than te/: Finally, although it appears to have no strength at all, ZkZsh, in fact, is the strongest of them all since it supports all of the other four.

All this is achieved through the force of the uptisang of God. Without upgsani, though, nothing can be accomplished.

One should examine oneself in this manner. For example, if one's ears are drawn to worldly talks just as much as they are drawn to talks related to God, then one should realise, 'My desire for God is equal to my desire for the world. ' One should similarly examine all of the other vishays, i. , sights, smells, tastes and touch. While examining himself in this manner, if a person gradually decreases his worldly desires and increases his desire for God, he begins to develop an understanding whereby he views all vishays as equal. After such equanimity has developed, honours and insults will appear to be the same to him. Moreover, pleasant and unpleasant types of touch will appear to be the same; attractive sights and unattractive sights will appear to be the same; a girl, a young lady and an old woman will appear to be the same; gold and refuse will appear to be the same as well. Similarly, pleasant and unpleasant tastes and smells will also appear to be the same. When a person can instinctively behave in this way, it should be known that his worldly desires have been overcome. 4 \"In fact, to behave above the influence of worldly desires is the dharma of one who is eka'ntik. But, if some desires do remain, then even if a person is able to attain samtidhi and control his nldi and przns, those desires will draw him back out of samzdhi. Therefore, only a person who overcomes worldly desires is an ekgntik bhakta. \" Thereupon Muktanand Swami asked, \"What are the means to eradicate worldly desires. \" Shriji Maharaj replied, \"Firstly, one requires firm ItmZ- realisation; secondly, one should realise the insignificance of the panchvikhays, and thirdly, one should realise the profound greatness of God; i. , 'God is the master of all abodes- Vaikunth, Golok, Brahmamahol, etc. So, having attained that God, why should I have affection for the pleasures of the vishays, which are futile.

What is that conviction? Well, he realises that God is not like kil, not like karma, not like swabhiv, not like miyi, and not like Purush. He realises God to be distinct from everything, their controller and cause; yet, despite being their cause, He is beyond their influence. A person who has cultivated a conviction of the manifest form of God in this manner will never be deflected in any way. Even if he hears misleading scriptures, or if he hears the talks of misleading philosophers, or even if his own antahkaran raises doubts within himself, his conviction of God never wavers in any way whatsoever. \"A person with such a conviction of God is said to have a rapport with God. Moreover, one naturally acquires the virtues of whomever one has a rapport with. For example, when our eyes meet with an oil lamp, the light of that oil lamp enters our eyes, thus expelling the darkness present before them. In the same manner, one who has developed a rapport with God by having a firm conviction of Him acquires the redemptive virtues of God. As a result, just as God is unattached in all respects and is capable of doing as He chooses, such a devotee also becomes extremely capable and unattached. \" Thereafter NirvikGrinand Swami asked, \"Despite having the conviction of God, noble virtues are still not acquired; on the contrary, egotism and jealousy are increasing day by day.

Similarly, a person who is demonic and extremely undeserving will still not forsake his own swabhivs even if he comes into contact with God.

Consequently, the offender suffers severely. For example, Hiranyakashipu was so powerful that he had conquered swarg Mrutyulok and pitit but because he harassed Prahlldji, God manifested from a pillar in the form of Nrusinh and killed Hiranyakashipu. \"Bearing this in mind, a devotee of God should strive to cultivate humility and should never insult anyone.

To illustrate this, consider the analogy of a great king. If even his servants and maids stay in seven-storey havelis, and their gardens, horses, carriages, ornaments, and other such luxuries make their houses appear as majestic as Devlok, then imagine how majestic the darbir and its luxuries of that king must be. Similarly, consider the realms of the lords of this brahmind- Brahmii and the other deities - who follow the commands of Shri Purushottam Bhagwan. If there is no limit to those realms and their opulence, then how can one possibly comprehend the extent of the opulence of Virgt-Purush from whose navel Brahmii was produced. Furthermore, the master of countless millions of such Virlt-Purushes is Purushottam Bhagwiinwhose abode is Akshar. Within that abode, countless millions of such brahmiinds float like mere atoms in each and every hair of Akshar. Such is the abode of God. In that abode, Purushottam Bhagwan Himself resides eternally with a divine form. Moreover, countless divine objects exist in that abode. So, if this is the greatness of Akshar, then how can one possibly comprehend the extent of God's greatness. One with faith understands God's greatness in this manner. 8 \"Besides, that which is greater than another is subtler than the other and is also its cause. For example, jal is greater than pruthvi, is the cause of that pruthvi and is subtler than it as well. In turn, tejis greater than jal, viyu is greater than tel; and ikish is greater than vzyu. In the same way, Akshar, Prakruti-Purush, PradhZn-Purush, mahattattva and ahamkir are all progressively greater than each other, the cause of each other and subtler than each other. They also possess a form. 9 \"In comparison, however, God's AkshardhLm is extremely large. Countless millions of brahmznds float like mere atoms in each of its hairs. Just as an ant moving on the body of a huge elephant appears insignificant, likewise, before the greatness of that Akshar, everything else pales into insignificance.

The cause of all of these is Aksharbrahma, which is the abode of Purushottam Bhagwiin. \"That Akshar does not have any states of contraction or expansion; it forever remains in the same state. That Akshar also possesses a form, but because it is so vast, its form cannot be visualised. For example, the brahmind, which has evolved from the 24 elements2, is known as Purushivat5r.

So if the end of the lotus could not be reached, how can VirFit-Purush possibly be gauged? Therefore, the form of Viriit-Purush cannot be visualised. In the same manner, despite having a definite form, Akshardhiim cannot be visualised. This is because it is so vast that countless brahminds float within its each and every hair. 11 \"It is within that Akshardhlm that Purushottam BhagwIn Himself eternally resides.

Moreover, despite possessing a definite form, He is the drashti of both the drashti and the drashya. 6 \"Furthermore, He is the inspirer of both the a'tm5 and Akshar, is independent from them and is their controller.

Out of compassion, that Purushottam Bhagwan appears as a human being on this earth for the liberation of jivas. Understanding Him to eternally possess a divine form, a person who offers bhakti and upgsani to Him acquires qualities similar to those of God as well as countless other spiritual powers. After such a person's itma has attained Brahma-realisation, he constantly remains in the service of Purushottam Bhagwiin with love and great reverence. On the other hand, a person who meditates on God and does his upa'sani believing Him to be formless is consigned to brahma-sushupti, from which he never returns. Nor does such a person ever acquire any spiritual powers from God. \" Finally, Shriji Maharaj added, \"I have delivered this discourse having experienced it directly Myself. Therefore, there is not a trace of doubt about it.

When it becomes old, however, the cavities of its indriyas decrease in size, and the PkZsh within also appears to contract. Similarly, when Virlt's body is produced, ZkZsh appears to be created in the cavity of his heart and other internal organs. Moreover, when Virlt's body is destroyed, the ikZsh within appears to be destroyed as well. This is how ikZsh is created and destroyed. However, just as Prakruti- Purush are eternal, the ikish that is the supporter of all is also eternal and is not subject to creation or destruction. Furthermore, iktsh is also created and destroyed through sama'dhi; one who experiences samidhi knows its method. \" Thereafter Paramlnand Swiimi asked Swayampraklshiinand Swgmi, \"How does the sushumni nZdi reside within the body and outside of the body. \" I SwayarnprakiishZinand SwEmi attempted to answer the question but could not do so satisfactorily. So Shriji Mahlrlj replied, 'Whatever is present in this brahmZnd is also present within this body; the only difference is that in the body the scale is small, whereas in the brahmznd it is large.

When rajogun is predominant, the fruits of any karmas performed are experienced in the dream state. When tamogun is predominant, the fruits of any karmas performed are experienced in the deep sleep state. Moreover, when a jiva enters the state of deep sleep, it becomes inert like a slab of stone and retains no type of consciousness; such as, 'I am a pundit, or I am a fool; I have done this task, or I want to do this task; this is my gender; or this is my caste, or this is my Zshram; this is my name, or my appearance is like this. Am I a deity, or am I a human. Am I a child, or am I old. Am I righteous, or am I a sinner. No such consciousness is retained. When a jiva enters such a state, God awakens it from unconsciousness through His 'gn5nshakti' and makes it aware of its actions. This is known as 'gnln-shakti', the faculty of cognition. Furthermore, whatever action a jiva engages in, it does so with the support of what is known as God's 'kriyii-shakti', the faculty of conation. Finally, whatever object a jiva desires, it acquires with the help of what is known as God's 'ichchhl-shakti', the faculty of volition. \"Moreover, the three states of waking, dream and deep sleep experienced by a jiva are not due to the consequences of its own karmas alone. They are experienced only when the giver of the fruits of karmas, God, allows the jiva to do so. When a jiva, indulging in the fruits of the waking state, wishes to enter the dream state, it cannot do so independently. This is because God, the giver of the fruits of karmas, restrains its vrutti. Similarly, if it wishes to enter the waking state from the dream state, it is unable to do so. Nor can it enter the deep sleep state or emerge from it to enter the dream or waking states. It is only when God, who grants the fruits of karmas, allows it to indulge in the fruits of the karmas of that particular state that it is able to indulge in them. However, a jiva cannot indulge in the fruits of its karmas according to its own will or as. a direct consequence of its karmas. This is how one should understand the 'gnIn-shakti', 'kriyl-shakti' and 'ichchhii-shakti' of God.",

Neither should he harbour any form of arrogance, but instead, he should behave as a servant of servants with all. 6 \"In comparison, having a hostile personality is the dharma of a wicked person, and behaving in a calm manner is the dharma of a sidhu.

Well, it is rather like the small piece of glass that women attach into works of embroidery - the mind represents the embroidery, and the jiva represents the piece of glass. In this manner, the words and the sights of those kusangis, along with the other types of w'shays, have become imprinted in the mind.",

Thereby, the words and the sight of the Sant dwell in the person's mind. 7 \"Analogously, then, there are two armies facing each other. In the battlefield of Kurukshetra, for example, the armies of the Kauravs and the PHndavs stood facing each other and fought with arrows, spears, projectiles, artillery and chains. Some fought with swords, some with maces, others with their bare hands. In the process, some lost their heads, others injured their thighs and many were slaughtered. In the same way, in the person's antahkaran are the forms of the kusangis standing armed with their weapons, i. , the panchvishays; as well as the form of the Sant standing armed with weapons in the form of words such as, 'God is satya; the world is perishable; and the vishays are false. ' A mutual conflict thus exists between these two sets of words. When the force of the kusangis prevails, a desire to indulge in the vishays arises; when the force of the Sant prevails, the desire to indulge in the vishays disappears. In this way, there is a conflict within the antahkaran. Hence the verse: w i'Fr~t~i:w,d ~ e iqr * I r n M r n * l l i This verse explains: 'Where there is Yogeshwar - Shri Krishna Bhagwan - and where there is the great archer Arjun, only there do Lakshmi, victory, divine powers and resolute morality exist.

On the other hand, there is another person whose conflict is stiIl ongoing. Of the two, when the former dies, there is no doubt that he will attain the abode of God. But please tell us what will be the fate of the latter - whose conflict is still ongoing - when he dies. \" Shriji Maharaj explained, \"On waging war, one person may face VIniyds or someone from a weak caste. ConsequentIy, he may win easily. Another person, however, is confronted by a battalion of Arabs, Rajputs, Kithis and Kolswho are very difficult to conquer, certainly not as easy to defeat as the Viniiyiis. Therefore, his fight continues. If, in the process of such fighting, he wins, then all is well and good. But if while fighting he does not give in to his opponents - despite their - attempts and if he were to die at that time, would his master not be aware of his valiant efforts. Would He not appreciate that, compared to the one who faced the easy opposition of the ViniyZs, this person faced formidable opposition that was difficult to overcome. The master wouId indeed be well aware of both situations. In the same way, God is sure to help such a person as you have described. He would believe, 'This person is faced with the overwhelming force of fluctuating thoughts, yet he is still putting up a gallant fight. Therefore, he deserves to be congratulated. ' Realising this, God does help him. For this reason, then, one should remain carefree and not worry in the least. One should continue to worship God in the same fashion, keep the Sant predominant, and stay away from kusangis. \" Shriji Mahiriij thus replied in a joyful manner.",

However, if one keeps the company of kusangis, such unfaltering faith will not develop. \" Again Shriji Mahlrij said, \"Allow Me to answer that question. \" Continuing, He said, \"One should cultivate faith in God for the sole purpose of the liberation of one's jva, but not out of a desire for some material object. For example, 'If I practise satsang, my ill body will recover,' or 'As I am childless, may I get a son,' or 'As my sons are dying, may they stay alive,' or 'Since I am poor, may I become rich,' or 'If I do satsang, I will regain my lost assets. ' One should not practise satsang harbouring desires for such material gains. If one does practise satsang while nourishing such desires, then one may become a very staunch satsangi if those desires are fulfilled; but if one's desires are not fulfilled, one's faith will diminish. Therefore, one should practise satsang solely for the liberation of one's jiva; one should no\" harbour any desire whatsoever for any material objects. \"Besides, if there are ten members in a household and all ten are faced with death, then is it a small feat if even one is saved. Or if one was destined to have to beg for food but received a rotlo to eat instead, is that a small feat. In these cases, one should believe that although everything was going to be lost, at least this much has been saved. In the same way, even if extreme misery is due to befall one, that misery would certainly decrease slightly if one were to keep the refuge of God. The jiva, however, fails to understand this. It is as if one who is to be executed on a shuligets away with the suffering of a mere pinprick. Such is the difference. 16 'There is a story illustrating this: Many thieves lived in a particular village. One of these thieves often kept the company of a sPdhu. Once, while the thief was on his way to visit the sidhu, a thorn pierced his foot, penetrating it completely. As a result, his foot became swollen and he was unable to accompany the other thieves to steal. The other thieves, who went to steal,.",

On hearing this news, the parents, wife and relatives of the thief who used to sit with the szdhu and who was injured scolded him: 'Because you went to the szdhu instead of going to steal, we lost out. The thieves who did go to steal returned with a lot of money. ' Meanwhile, the king's army arrived, arrested all of the thieves and took them away to be executed on a shuli. The injured thief was also caught and consigned to execution. However, all of the villagers and the sidhu bore witness, 'This particular man was not involved in the theft as he had been hurt by a thorn. ' The thief was thus released. 17 \"In the same way, if a person who practises satsangwere to face the suffering of being executed on a shuli, it would be reduced to the pain of a mere thorn-prick. After all, I have asked of RIminand Swami, 'If your satsangi is destined to suffer the distress inflicted by the sting of one scorpion, may the distress of the stings of millions and millions of scorpions befall each and every pore of my body; but no pain should afflict your satsangi. Moreover, if the begging bowl is written in the przrabdha of your satsangi may that begging bow1 come to Me; but on no account should your satsangi suffer from the lack of food or clothing. Please grant Me these two boons. ' I asked this of Riimlnand Swami, and he happily granted it to Me. Therefore, even if worldly miseries are destined to befall anyone practising satsang, they do not. 18 \"Anyhow, material objects are all temporary. So if a person practises satsang entertaining desires for such objects, then doubts will certainly cloud his faith. Therefore, other than the desire for the liberation of one's own jva, one should practise satsang having no desires whatsoever. Only then will unfaltering faith develop. \" is This is only a portion of the detailed discourse delivered by Shriji Mahirij. Vachansmrut Gadhadii 1-70 l l.",

Furthermore, the greatness of God is such that within the pore of His each and every hair, countless millions of brahminds appear as mere sub-atomic particles.

What, then, can be said of mere humans. Consider, for example, the vadvznal fire that dwells in the ocean. Despite consuming the waters of the ocean, it is so vast that even the water of the ocean itself cannot extinguish it. If we wished to light an oil lamp in our homes and that vadviinal fire were to enter our homes, instead of enjoying the light of the oil lamp, we would all be burnt and reduced to ashes.

This implies that as long as there is semen in the body, it is sure to be discharged whenever one associates with a woman in the waking or dream state, So then, as long as there is semen in the body, how can one be called a perfect celibate. \" Shriji Mahiirlj explained, 'That can be said to be a fault in Shivji's yogic powers. A person whose semen is discharged in the waking or dream state by the thought of a woman cannot be called a staunch brahrnachiri. That is why in this whole world Narniriyan Rishi is the only one who has firm brahmacharya. Since we have accepted the refuge of that Narnzriiyan Rishi, by his grace, we shall also gradually become perfect celibates like him -by worshipping him. 10 'Yogis endeavour in many ways to burn the semen which remains in the body.

It is said that he had ten sons and one daughter by each wife. How should one understand this. \" Shriji MahBrij clarified, 'The incidents of Dwiirikii are one thing, and the incidents of Vraj are another. In Dwiirikii, Shri Krishna Bhagwan had adopted the principle of Sinkhya. A follower of the Sinkhya principle believes his own self to be distinct from the mind, body and indriyas. While performing all actions, he does not regard himself as being the doer of those actions, nor does he experience either joy or grief from those actions. That was the principle adopted by Shri Krishna Bhagwin there; therefore he was said to be uninfluenced. The Siinkhya principle adopted by Shri Krishna Bhagwan in Dwlrikd is the very same Siinkhya principle observed by kings such as Janak, who worshipped God as householders. In the same way, Shri Krishna Bhagwan was also a householder and was known as the king of Dwlrikl. Therefore, because he followed the SBnkhya principle, he remained uninfluenced as well. 13 \"In Vrundiivan, however, Shri Krishna BhagwBn had adopted the principle of Yoga, by which he maintained his vow of perfect brahmacharya despite associating with women. At that time, he displayed the powers of Narniiriyan Rishi within himself. In the Shrimad BhSgwat, Kapildev explains to Devhuti, 'No one except Narnlriiyan Rishi is capable of overcoming my mZy5 in the form of women. ' But, Shri Krishna Bhagwan conquered lust while associating with women. \"Now consider the following incident: When DurvBsii Rishi came and Shri Krishna Bhagwiin began sending all of the gopis with dishes filled with food for him, the gopis asked, 'How shall we cross the Yamuniiji river.

' Thereafter, when the gopis said this to Yamunlji, it made way for them. Seeing this, the gopis were extremely surprised. However, they were unable to realise the greatness of Shri Krishna Bhagwan or the rishi. 20 \"Shri Krishna Bhagwan played with the gopis while maintaining his vow of perfect brahmacharya and was therefore still a brahmacha'ri.

However, the vadvinal fire that rests in the ocean cannot be extinguished even by the waters of the ocean itself. Similarly, vairigya compounded with gnin is like the vadvinal fire and the fire of lightning - it is inextinguishable.

As a result, the heart of that person who perceives faults in the Setpurush is gravely troubIed by disturbing thoughts. Although he may practise satsang, he never ceases to be unhappy. 'Those who are wise realise all My characteristics by staying close to Me. They realise, 'Mahgrgj has no affection for any object in this world that can arouse infatuationwealth, women, ornaments, food and drink, etc. In fact, Mahiirgj remains dejected from all these things.

In fact, they remain even after mastering sama'dhi. After attaining samidhi, there is no way a person can return from the form of Brahma back into his body. Yet, if he does return, it is because of one of three reasons: Firstly, he returns to his body from samidhi if he harbours desires for worldly pleasures. Or, if someone is extremely powerful, he can enter into samidhi and return to the body according to his own will. Lastly, if there is another pers0. n who is much more powerful than oneself, then that person can bring one back into the body from samzdhi.

But one should never associate with a sinner. \" Then, at midday, Shriji Mahlrlj called all of the young, student ssdhus near and requested, \"All of you student szdhus, please ask Me questions. \" Thereupon Mot5 Shivlnand Swami asked, \"How can a person who has unwavering faith in God be recognised. \" Shriji Mahiirlj replied, \"A person with unwavering faith in God regards all actions performed by God as redemptivewhether they be good or bad. Whether God wins or loses, or at times even runs away; whether He shows pleasure or grief; in fact, however many countless kinds of actions a faithful devotee witnesses, he says, 'All actions of God are for the sake of liberation. ' If, whenever the devotee speaks, he speaks in this manner only, then he should be known to have absolute faith in God. \" Thereafter NirmHnlnand Swami asked, \"How can a person prevent the development of a fault-finding attitude towards God and His sZdhus. \" Shriji Maharaj answered, \"If a person possesses the aforesaid unwavering faith in God, then he never develops a fault-finding attitude towards God. Furthermore, when he thinks upon the greatness of the servants of such a great God, he never perceives faults in the devotees of God either. \" Then NirmlnHnand Swami and NBnl Pragnanand Swami both asked, \"How can one realise the form of God in all the three states of waking, dream and deep sleep.",

Therefore, all of the inner enemies - egotism, arrogance, matsar, jealousy, etc. - of a person who is loyal to Satsang are destroyed.

Therefore, developing bitter hatred towards the particular base swabhiv that has led to one's disgrace, one should adopt means that would totally uproot it. When we behave in this way, God and His Sant shower total compassion upon us. Whenever God and His disciples shower their compassion, one continues to experience extreme bliss within one's heart.

Then, on noticing this, if God or a senior siidhu takes care of one's body, it is well and good, but one should not knowingly take care of one's own body. Also, one should physically serve God and His devotees. When God or that great siidhu notice a person behaving in this manner physically, they develop affection for him, and that devotee also develops affection for God. 11 \"Now I shall describe the manner in which a person should behave regarding the virtues of the mind.

When he begins to do darshan in such a mundane manner, he does not remain as pious as he previously was; in fact, he declines day by day. Therefore, while doing darshan of God one should not look from side to side. The novelty and divinity experienced in one's heart at the time of the first darshan of God shouId remain exactly the same. Moreover, one should look at the form with a fixed gaze and then closing one's eyes, one should internalise that form exactly as it is in one's heart. For example, in Dharmapur, Kushalkuvarbai did My darshan, and at the same time, closed her eyes and internalised the form in her heart. Similarly, one should do darshan while keeping an attentive mind and a fixed gaze, but one should not do darshan as other ordinary people do.

However, if, while doing darshan of God's form, the vrutti of one's eyes and ears leaves the form aside and is attracted towards other things, one should reprimand them, saying, '0 fools. What are you going to achieve by looking at forms other than God and by listening to words other than the talks of God. As of yet, you have not attained any yogic powers whereby you can instantly receive whatever you wish. This is because you are still in the process of enlightenment. So, you are not going to be able to obtain those vihays that you desire; so why are you futilely grasping for them and leaving God aside. Moreover, even if you were to attain some insignificant vishay, then due to the sin incurred as a result, there will be no end to the beatings you will receive in Yampuri. ' In this manner, one should reprimand one's eyes and ears. 19 \"Furthermore, one should also tell them, 'When you become stabilised in the form of God, you will be enlightened in this very life. As a result, you will be able to naturally hear any talk occurring in any brahmind If you desire to have a charming form like that of BrahmH, Vishnu or Shiv, then you will be able to attain such a form. Or, if you wish to become a devotee like Lakshmi or RHdhikl, then you will become so. Moreover, if, while worshipping God, you do not attain enlightenment in this very life, you will attain enlightenment after death, when you become a mukta. But without becoming enlightened, even if you constantly look at some charming object until you die, you will still not be able to attain that charm. Furthermore, even if.",

He also understands the profound greatness of God. With each passing day, both of these two aspects remain ever fresh, but never diminish. For example, Muktanand Swiimi's shraddhi and understanding of God's greatness are exactly the same today and just as fresh as they were when I first saw him in Lojpur; they have not diminished in any way whatsoever. In the same manner, such a devotee should be recognised by these two characteristics. 6 \"All of the Yidavs who stayed with Shri Krishna BhagwHn did not have such shraddhi or understanding of God's greatness; they served him just like they would serve other kings. Therefore, they did not achieve fame and are not even regarded as devotees. On the other hand, Uddhavji served Shri Krishna Bhagwan with shraddhi and an understanding of his greatness, and therefore he has been described as an eminent devotee of God and has been extremely renowned in the scriptures and in the world. \" I Thereafter Nirvikiirlnand Swiimi asked, \"Maharaj, what is 'shravan', 'manan', 'nididhyiis' and 'siikshatkiir'. \" Shriji Maharaj explained, \"To listen to a talk through one's ears is known as 'shravan'. Then, having heard the talk, to mentally ponder over the talk, and to discard that part of the talk which is fit to be discarded and to retain that part of the talk which is fit to be retained is known as 'manan'. Then, having mentally retained the talk with conviction, the practice of continuously recalling the talk day and night is known as 'nididhyls'. Finally, when one can recall that talk exactly as it was - as if it were manifest before one - with absolute clarity and spontaneity, that is known as 'sEksh5tkir'. 9 \"If one engages in 'shravan', 'manan' and 'nididhyiis' of the nature of the itmi in this manner, then one will attain 'slkshiitkiir' of the itm5 Furthermore, if one engages in 'shravan', 'manan' and 'nididhyls' of God in this manner, then one will attain 'siikshItklr' of God.

On the other hand, if one had done darshan of God's entire body, and had subsequently done 'manan' and 'nididhyis' of all of the parts of His body, then one would be able to easily recall those parts even today. Conversely, one who had done only darshan of God's body would be unable to recall it, even if one attempted to recall it. 11 \"Also, there are some devotees who say, We sit in meditation and try very hard to recall MahZrEj's form, yet we cannot visualise even a single part. How, then, can we possibly envision the whole form. The reason for this is the same as abovethey merely do darshan of the form, without doing 'manan' and 'nididhyiis'. How then can it be visualised. After all, if one has merely seen even a worldly object with one's eyes, or merely listened to it with one's ears, and it is not subsequently mentally recalled, it will be forgotten.

So, once one has cultivated such an understanding clearly, no misconception remains about the itmi and non-atma being one. Furthermore, only such clear understanding leads to happiness, whereas a foolish understanding does not lead to happiness. Therefore, one should clearly understand, 'I am the itm& and not a single one of my characteristics can be found in the body. Moreover, not one of the characteristics of the body - which is /ad, full of misery and perishablecan be found in me since I am chaitanya. ' After making such a distinction and becoming totally free of worldly desires, one should believe oneself to be chaitanya and contemplate upon Purushottam Bhagwan.

He will not experience happiness in his heart. For example, there may be some delicious food which is comparable to amrut, but if just a small amount of poison were to be mixed with it, then that food would never give one pleasure; on the contrary, it would lead to misery. In the same way, a person may think of the itml all day, but if he believes himself to be the body and fantasises about women, even for just a moment, then all of his thoughts are futile. Therefore, one should engage in contemplation purely of the atma so as to become totally free of worldly desires. 5 \"Now, someone may doubt: 'What wiIl become of me if I do not become totally free of worldly desires and happen to die in that imperfect state.

Of these, if only the knowledge of God's greatness is extremely powerful and the other threeshad&& faith and - affection are weak, then they will also become extremely powerful. On the other hand, although one may appear to have intense bhakti, if it is not coupled with the knowledge of God's greatness, it will ultimately be destroyed. For example, a tenor twelve-year-old girl who has contracted tuberculosis will certainly die before she matures into a young woman. Similarly, one whose bhakti lacks the knowledge of God's greatness will find that his bhakti will be destroyed before it matures. 4 \"Furthermore, if a person has bhaktifor God in his heart coupled with the knowledge of God's greatness, then even though he does not possess any other redemptive virtues, they will still develop in his heart. Conversely, if a person does not have bhakti in his heart coupled with the knowledge of God's greatness, then even though he possesses redemptive virtues such as tranquillity, self-restraint, etc. , they are as good as being absent because they will ultimately be destroyed. Therefore, even if one possesses only bhakti coupled with the knowledge of God's greatness, the worldly desires which one harbours will still be eradicated, and all of the redemptive virtues will develop and reside within one's heart.

Yet, only when the sukshma body is interwoven with the sthul body can all activities be carried out properly, but not otherwise. This is because only when the sukshma body, together with the indriyas, joins the sthul body - which includes the indnyas'organs, i. , the eyes, ears, etc. - can the respective vishays of those indriyas be indulged in. This is not possible by the indriyas'organs of the sthulbody alone. Thus, the suksifima body composed of the 19 elements is interwoven with the sthul body composed of the five elements.

Furthermore, although the former devotee's bhaktiis extremely appealing, he possesses neither knowledge of the Htmd nor vairiigya. The latter may have knowledge of the Htmd and vairzgya, but his bhakti is not as appealing as the former devotee's. Of these two devotees, whose bhakti is superior, and whose bhakti is inferior. That is the question. \" To this, Swayamprakishiinand SwImi replied, \"He who has intense love for God is better, even if he does not have knowledge of the Ztml and vairigya. \" Shriji Maharaj then countered, \"With what understanding do you say that he who does not have knowledge of the HtmH and vairigya is better. Such a person believes his self to be the body, and so whenever he comes upon any of the panchvishays that comfort his body, he will develop affection for them. Consequently, his love for God will diminish. So why do you consider him to be superior.",

They also spoke as eloquently as those who are well-versed in diplomacy. In addition, they knew God precisely as he should be known. Even Uddhav, the wisest of the YCdavs and God's agent, became overwhelmed when he realised the gopis' understanding. That same Uddhavji later said, 'God has shown great mercy to me by sending me to impart gnZn to the gopis. ' He had actually gone to preach to the gopis, but upon hearing their words, he himself imbibed the gopis'preaching. 7 \"Though you may say that the gopis were not very intelligent, there were, in fact, three distinctions amongst them: obstinate, mediocre, and mature. 8 \"Of these, the characteristics of the obstinate gopis are as follows: They would often rebuke God and say, 'We have gone out of our way doing things for you, yet you do not take even the slightest notice of us. ' Furthermore, if they were teased further, they would be upset with God and speak such harsh words that one would feel they will soon fall from the path of God. Those gopis who are described as such in the scriptures should be known as obstinate gopis. 9 \"Those who are mediocre gopis, however, would never become angry with God and would never speak such harsh words. But by using their shrewdness, they would employ cunning ploys to conceal their selfishness from others and do whatever they please while also doing whatever pleases God; i. , they would not do only that which pleases God. Furthermore, even if they have to do something that pleases only God, they would definitely use a cunning method to do whatever pleases themselves as well.

They would also renounce vicious natures such as egotism, matsar, etc. , and remain alert in the service of God. They would never do anything by thought, word or deed that would displease God. Those gopis who are described as such in the scriptures should be known as mature gopis. In this manner, there are three distinctions amongst the gopis. 11 \"Overall, the gopis had extreme wisdom in their understanding, and thus their love cannot be said to be without understanding. Also, they had thoroughly realised the greatness of God. Due to the power of that realisation of God's greatness, the virtues of 5tm5-realisation and vairzgya naturally flourished in their hearts. Therefore, it was due to the power of realising God's greatness that countless redemptive virtues such as atmarealisation, vairZma, etc. , were fully developed in the gopis. 12 \"Now the characteristics of such a devotee are as follows: He wishes for only those panchvishays, i. , sights, sounds, smells, tastes and touch, which are related to God, but not for those which are related to anything else. Then through those vishays, he develops intense affection for God. So much so, that even though he does not possess the virtues of 5tm5-realisation and vairzgya, he still does not harbour any desire in his heart except for that of God. \"Consider the following example: When it has not rained, the seeds of different types of grass cannot be seen anywhere on the earth. But when it does rain, so much grass grows that even the earth cannot be seen. Similarly, when one who does not possess the virtues of itmi-realisation and vaira'gya meets with bad company, though he may seem to have no desire for vishays other than God, he will begin to harbour desires for those objects.

Likewise, if a person who has the previously mentioned virtues of swadharma, vairPgya, etc. , firmly rooted in his heart and who has not even the slightest desire for the pleasures of this world were to meet with evil company, then waters in the form of evil company would sweep across his heart and leave behind silt in the form of worldly talks, etc. Subsequently, the seeds of lust, anger, avarice, infatuation, arrogance, matsar, etc. , which are dormant in the silt, would grow into large trees.

In fact, it is said in the Shrimad BhHgwat: $@i. -:morrq v l l l m:I mefaonefqm+rswma~~i This verse means: God created the buddhl; indriyas, man and prIns of all people to enable the jivas to indulge in the wshays, to take birth, to transmigrate to other realms, and to attain liberation. Therefore, God created this cosmos for the sake of the jivad liberation; God sustains it for the sake of the jivad liberation; in fact, God also causes its dissolution for the sake of the jivad liberation. Well, He destroys it to allow the jivastired as a result of undergoing many births and deaths - to rest, That God, who acts in all ways for the benefit of the jivas, becomes like a human out of compassion. Then, when the jivas maintain profound association with the Sant of that God, why should they not be able to know Him. They certainly can know Him. \" Thereupon Bhajaninand Swami asked, \"Why then, MahCirgj, does the Vedic verse claim: & W qp. \" Shriji MahHrCij replied in a pleased tone 'Well, in that case, the facts are as follows: pruthviresides in dkIsh, but does not become like a'kish; jal also resides in ikish, but does not become like Pki&, tej also resides in a'kdsh, but does not become like ikIh; and VIPa lso resides in ikish, but does not become like IkIsh.

The mind and indriyas of devotees of God, however, do attain Godrealisation. For example, at the time of dissolution, pruthvi, which resides in akash, becomes one with ikish; j'al also becomes one with 5kish; tej also becomes one with dkish; and v i p also becomes one with ikish. Similarly, the bodies, indriyas, antahkarans and priins of those who are devotees of God, due to their gnin of God, become like God. This is because God's form is itself divine. So, the bodies, indriyas and antahkarans of those devotees become like God's indriyas, antahkaran and body. That is why those devotees' bodies, indriyas, ant ahkarans and prZns become divine. 26 \"The following example will clarify: A bee captures a worm, stings it and then buzzes over it. As a result, that worm - in the very same body - is transformed into a bee. Thereafter, none of its bodily parts remain like that of a worm; it becomes exactly like a bee. Similarly, a devotee of God, in that very same body, becomes divine like God. \" Shriji Maharaj then concluded by saying, 'The essence of this talk that I have given is that for both a person with firmness in bhakti coupled with 5tmi-realisation, and for a person with firmness in bhakti alone, progress is as described. However, the indriyas and antahkaran of a person with zZtrnZ- realisation only, i. , one who aspires for keval-gngn, do not become divine like God's form; he attains only brahmasattZW i Niranjanaha paramam simyam -upaiti// He who is free from [the] blemishes [of mZy4 attains qualities similar to those of the Supreme Being, [i.

Similarly, if a person whose intellect is cursed observes nljams only to the extent that everyone else does, then that flaw will not be eradicated. He should not remain only as free of lust, taste, avarice, attachment, and egotism as others. Rather, he should become more free of lust than others; he should become more free of avarice than others; he should become more free of taste than others; he should become more free of attachment than others; and he should become more free of egotism than others. Also, he should go to sleep later than others; he should chant the name of God with a rosary more often than others; and he should wake up a little earlier than others.

So how should one understand the nirgun form, and how shouId one understand the sagun form of Shri Purushottam. Also, how much does a devotee of God benefit by understanding the nirgun form of that God, and how much does he benefit by understanding the sagun form of that God. \" Shriji Mahlrij replied, \"The nirgun form of God is much subtler than that which is subtle. It is the Ptmi of all of the elements such as pruthvi, jal, etc. ; it is the HtmP of Pradhan- Purush, which are higher than those elements; and it is the PtmP of pure Purush and Prakruti which are themselves higher than PradhSn-Purush; it is the Htmi of even Akshar who is higher than them. All of these constitute the sharir of God. Just as the jiva is subtler, purer and of greater luminosity than the body, in the same manner, compared to all of the other entities, God is much more subtle, pure, unaffected and luminous. For example, HkPsh pervades the four bhutspruthw; jal, etc. Moreover, it remains unaffected by those four bhuts, and the influences of those four bhuts do not affect akash. In fact, despite dwelling in those four bhuts, akash remains absolutely unaffected. In the same way, Purushottam Bhagwan dwells in all as their PtmZ Despite this, He is absolutely unchanged and untainted, and He maintains His own uniaue characteristics; no one is capable of becoming like.",

Similarly, Purushottam Bhagwan is the itml of all, yet no one up to and including Akshar is capable of becoming as powerful as Purushottam Bhagwin. In this manner, being extremely subtle, extremely unaffected, extremely pure, extremely untainted, extremely luminous, and possessing tremendous, divine powers is the nirgun aspect of the form of that God. For example, if Mount Girnir were to be placed next to Mount LokElok it would appear extremely small, Mount Girnir does not become smaller in any way, but before the extreme vastness of Lokglok, it appears small. In the same manner, before the vastness of Purushottam Bhagwan, countless millions of brahmznds, each encircled by the eight barrierss, appear extremely minute, like mere atoms. Those brahmznds do not become smaller, but before the vastness of God they appear small. In this way, the extreme vastness of the form of God is the sagun aspect of God. 4 'Then someone may doubt, 'In His nirgun form, God is subtler than the extremely subtle, and in His sawn form, He is more vast than the extremely vast. What, then, is the nature of the original form of God, who assumes both of these forms. ' 5 \"The answer to that is that the manifest form of God visible in a human form is the eternal and original form of God. His nirgun and sagun aspects are the special, divine powers of that form. For example, Shri Krishna Bhagw5n and Arjun sat in a chariot and went to retrieve the son of the BrZhmin. After crossing Mount LokBlok, they reached the darkness of mZyP. Shri Krishna pierced that mZyi using his Sudarshan Chakra. Then, reaching the light of Brahma, which transcends that miyz, he retrieved the son of the Brihmin from BhumC-Purush who resides there. In that situation, the chariot and horses were mzyik and physical, but through contact with Shri Krishna Bhagwan, they became extremely subtle and like chaitanya; thereby, they reached the nirgun Brahmadhiim of God. In this way, to impart subtlety to physical objects is the nirgzin aspect of Shri Krishna Bhagwan's form. 6 \"Furthermore, that same Shri Krishna Bhagwin showed the whole brahmind, including the eight barriers5 which.",

At that time, with the exception of Arjun, others saw the form of God as being three-and-a-half arms in height. Moreover, when God assumed the avatZrof Viiman, he initially gave darshan in the form of a dwarf. After he made Bali relinquish as much land as could be covered in three footsteps, he increased the size of his own form to such an extent that one footstep alone covered the seven pZtiiIs, with his own body covering the entire sky. With his second footstep, he covered the seven swargs and pierced the outer shell of the brahmiind King Bali saw this vast form of God, but others only saw the dwarf form assumed by God - exactly as it was visible. In this way, God's vastness, which is even more vast than the extremely vast, is the sagun aspect of God's form. For example, the sky is cloudless during winter and summer, but when monsoon arrives, it becomes overcast with innumerable clusters of clouds. With time, these clouds form in the sky and later disperse again.

' Also, Shri Krishna Bhagwiin told Baldevji that the trees, birds and deer in Vrundivan are extremely fortunate. Even Brahmii asked for a boon from Shri Krishna Bhagwiin: '0 God! May I be so highly blessed to be able to serve your holy feet in the midst of your servants, either in this life, or in the life of an animal or bird.

Moreover, one who understands such greatness never takes into account even minor drawbacks that are present in a devotee of the manifest form of one's own Ishtadev. In fact, one who realises the greatness of God looks upon even animals, trees, shrubs, etc. , which have come into contact with God as equivalent to deities. If that is so, what can be said of those people who are engaged in the bhakti of God, abiding by religious vows, and chanting the name of God? He would certainly look upon them as equivalent to deities and would not think ill of them. 7 'Therefore, one who understands the greatness of God does not develop animosity towards devotees of God.

He should be known to have his head severed. \" Then Bhagwadiinand Swami asked, \"If one has perceived flaws in a devotee, is there any method to atone for it, or not?\" Shriji Maharaj replied, \"There is a remedy, but it is extremely difficult; one who has intense shraddhl can do it. When flaws are perceived in the Sant, one should think, 'I have committed a grave sin by perceiving flaws in a brahmaswarup Bhakta of God. ' From such thoughts, he would feel intense regret in his heart. As a result of such regret, while eating, he would be unable to distinguish between tasty and tasteless foods, and at night he would be unable to sleep. As long as the aversion towards the Sant is not removed from the person's heart, he would experience extreme remorse, just like a fish would suffer without water. 3 1 \"On the other hand, when he intensely perceives virtues in that Sant, then if that Sant has been hurt in any way, he would please him with absolute humility. If this type of thought remains in a person's heart, then even if he has perceived flaws in the Sant, they would still be overcome, and he would not fall from Satsang. Apart from that, there is no other remedy; that is the only remedy. \" Vachanamrut Loyl-1 l 1 Loyli-2 One with Faith, Gniin, Courage or Affection On Kartik va& 11, Samvat 1877 [l December 18201, Swami Shri SahajPnandji Maharaj was sitting facing south on a large, decorated cot in SurP Khlchar's darbzr in Loyl.

For example, the entities evolved from Mul-Prakruti, the countless PradhBns, occupy a great expanse, whereas the cause, Mul-Prakruti, has the form of a female.

For example, Agni, Varun and Surya appear vast in the form of their effects, but they withdraw their effect back within themselves, and only they remain. In the same way, within each and every hair of God, countless brahmznds, each composed of the eight barriers5 and 14 realms, appear as mere atoms.

So, while still remaining in one location, what is surprising about Him manifesting, by His own wish, wherever and however is appropriate? What is so surprising about God possessing such abilities?

Why? Because one who hears those words realises the virtues of that sidhu; i. , 'In no way does this sa'dhu have attachment to his bodily relations or others.

In fact, one should not become suppressed by him, and in any question-answer exchange, his words should be answered with stern words of one's own. \" Then Shriji Mahhrfij asked, 'When should one not have a desire for the darshan, etc. , of God and His Sane When should one have such a desire?\" Shriji Mahiriij replied, \"Suppose I were to ask a11 of the s5dhus, 'Who will go to Buriinpur and Kiishi? Then, when no one speaks, one should rise in the assembly and say to Me, 'Maharaj, if you say so, I shall go. ' So saying, one should follow My command and go there. In those situations, to gain My pleasure, one should not keep any desire for keeping the company of the Sant or My darshan, etc. 26 ''Moreover, when one, who a sidhu or I have grieved, rebuked, insulted or expelled, and who is crying out of that shock, is approached by a non-beIiever, such as an ekadmal, who starts to talk about the flaws of the sZdhu or Me, then before him, one should exhibit tremendous affection towards the siidhu and God. One should say, 'I am His servant, and even if He were to cut me to pieces, I would still never perceive flaws in Him. He will grant Me liberation.

Thus, the intensity and mildness of lust, anger, etc. , can be noticed; but can they be weakened by any thought process?\" Shriji Mahlrij Himself replied, \"The force of lust, anger, etc. , can be weakened by a thought process, which is as follows: The mildness of those swabhivs in childhood, their greater intensity in youth, and mildness once again in old age is due to food. Specifically, in childhood, since the dietary intake is small, the force of lust is mild. Similarly, in old age, one's dietary intake is small, so again the force of lust is mild. But in youth, as the dietary intake increases, lust also increases. Therefore, in youth, if one's food intake is decreased, and if one deliberately tolerates cold, heat, rain and hunger, then by maintaining such a thought process, and by maintaining profound association with the great Sant, the force of lust is weakened - even in the period of youth. \" Again Shriji Mahlrij asked, \"People become addicted to many different types of things, for example, bhang, marijuana, opium, alcohol, etc. Are these addictions due to one's kriyamin or prirabdha karmas?\"",

Granted this, is the difference between these two types of people due to karmas, or is it eternal?\" Hearing this, Shriji Maharaj replied, \"Those differences are not inherently present in the jva; instead, they arise as a result of karmas. How does this happen? Well, when a jiva performs a karma, the force of its vruttis can be of three levels: mild, intermediate and intense. The force with which the vruttis attach themselves to the object determines the effect of the karma upon the jiva. As a result, three levels of affection arise due to these karmas. \" Again, Nitylnand Swami asked, \"Granted that fact, do the three levels in the force of the vruttis occur as a result of the gunas, or is there some other reason?\" Shriji MahlrGj replied, \"The three types of differences are not due to the gunas; rather, when only the indriyas indulge in an object, then a mild force results. When the indriyas indulge in an object along with the mind, an intermediate level of force - develops. When all three the indriyas, the mind and the - jiva combine and indulge in an object, then the vruttis develop an intense force. Even if that intense force affects only the eyes, the other indriyas would follow, and the force would affect them as well. In this way, whichever indnya is primarily affected by the intense force, the other indriyas follow. Moreover, that intense force affects all three types of people, rIjasik, sZttv12 and tiimasik. In fact, such intense force is present in each of the indriyas; thus, affection for objects arises correspondingly. \" Then Nityanand Swami asked, \"Why does he not develop affection for God with such an intense force?\" Shriji Mahgraj said, \"Good and bad behaviour is determined by the factors of place, time, action, meditation, scriptures, initiation, mantra and company. So, if one attains favourable places, times, company, etc. , then one develops affection for God quickly.

But, when both the mind and the jiva combine with the indriyas and look at the three types of women, then base thoughts arise towards all three types of women, and disturbance is experienced. In fact, one would experience such base thoughts even on seeing one's own mother or sister. This should be known as an intense force. \" Then Brahmiinand Swiimi asked, \"Suppose a person notices the distinction between the three types of women, and notices their beauty and ugliness, yet he does not experience any base thoughts -which type of force is that. \" Shriji Maharaj said, \"Having realised an object to be the cause of intense misery and having contemplated upon that fact, one attributes grave drawbacks to that object.

The witness', who transcends the jiva, also affirms those drawbacks, and so an extremely firm conviction in those drawbacks is developed. Thus, when the vruttis of the indriyas enter the object, the mind and jiva also go along with the vruttis, but since the jiva's deep conviction of the drawbacks in the object pierces the mind and indiiyas, even though the object is seen and fully recognised, still an intense aversion arises for it. For example, if a snake's venom is dropped in a bowl of sweet milk, and one sees the venom being added, then even though the milk appears exactly as before, an intense aversion for it prevails in one's heart. Why is that? Because one has realised, 'If I drink the milk, I will die. ' Similarly, such a person has realised, 'This beautiful woman is an obstacle on the path of liberation; and she is the cause of extreme misery in this realm and in the higher realms. In fact, I have attained the company of women countless times in past lives in various life forms, and if I do not worship God, I will attain the company of countless more females. Thus, this attainment is not rare. However, the company of God and His Sant is extremely rare, and this woman is a major obstacle in the attainment of that. ' A person who has realised this and has intensely realised the flaws in the object will never be infatuated on seeing a woman, regardless of how beautiful she may be. 14 \"Furthermore, there 1s another way to remain uninfatuated: Janak the Videhi, who was a great king and a devotee of God, stayed in his kingdom and, due to his firmness in gnan, remained uninfatuated even while indulging in enticing vishays. Similarly, a devotee with gnin like Janak, harbours the thought, 'I am the itmipure, chetan, unchanging, the embodiment of bliss, and imperishable. Kshays like women and other things, however, are full of misery; they are vain, perishable, and /ad' With this thought, he believes only his own self, the itmi, as being the embodiment of bliss. Also, he believes, 'The pleasure and pleasantness which are apparent in the vishaysi. , sounds, Here 'witness' refers to God",

Such a person, even if he is amongst people, feels as if he is in the forest; and though he may be in the forest, he experiences more happiness there than one does from ruling a kingdom. \"Such a devotee may reside in a kingdom, thousands of people may be under his command and he may be wealthy.

' This is because he remains absolutely carefree in his own bliss, and he knows the greatness of his own self and that of God. Thus, he views gold, dirt, iron and stones as equal; he also feels equanimity in honour and insult. Since his vision has become broad, and he knows all worldly objects to be vain, no objects are capable of binding such a person with gnin. For example, when a man who was initially poor receives a kingdom, his vision becomes broad. At first he may have been selling bundles of wood or doing various other insignificant jobs, but he forgets them all and he begins to do important tasks dated to his kingdom. Similarly, to such a person with gna'n, all objects become vain, and due to that gnan, his vision becomes broad. A person with such an understanding becomes happy. \"Also, if a person has faith, i. , he believes, Whatever such a great Sant and God say is the truth; there is no doubt in it,' and with such a belief, he does as God and His Sant instruct him to do, then such a person remains happy.

In this way, his form appears dreadful. But to a virtuous person, the form of Yamariijii appears very pleasant, like Vishnu. Similarly, to those who are non-believers, ma'ya' causes attachment and intense misery, while to a devotee of God, that same ma'ya' is the cause of intense happiness. Also, the entities that have evolved out of mPyithe indriyas and the antahkaran, and their presiding deitiesall support the bhakti of God. Therefore, for a devotee of God, rniydis not a cause of misery; it is a source of great happiness. \" Then Muktinand Swimi asked, \"If miyi is a cause of happiness, why is it that when a devotee of God visualises the form of God and engages in worship, mdyii, in the form of the antahkaran, causes misery by generating many disturbing thoughts?\" Shriji Maharaj replied, \"MIyZ, in the form of the antahkaran, does not cause misery to a person who thoroughly understands the greatness of God and has an absolutely firm refuge of God; but it does cause misery to a person who does not have such a refuge. For example, a kusangi would attempt to dislodge only an irresolute satsangi; but no one would dare to dislodge a staunch satsangi. In fact, no one would be able to speak ill of Satsang in his presence. Similarly, mdya', in the form of the antahkaran, would never entertain a desire to daunt a person who has a firm refuge in God. Rather, it would help his bhakti to flourish. However, mdyi does deflect a person who has a slight deficiency in his refuge in God and does cause him misery. Then, when that person develops a complete refuge in God, mPyZ is not able to disturb him or cause him pain. Therefore, the answer is that if a person has such complete faith in God, miyi is not capable of causing him misery. \" Vachangmrut hyi-10",

He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of sZdhus as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him. Thereupon Shuk Muni asked Shriji Maharaj, \"What understanding does an unholy person adopt from the Shrimad Bhiigwat, the Bhagwad GitS, and other sacred scriptures?\" Shriji Mahirlj replied, \"The answer is as follows: An unholy person believes that all of the mobile and immobile male and female forms in this world have been created through mdyz and the primordial Purush, VirIt, the form of God. This implies that all of these forms are, in fact, manifestations of God Himself. For this reason, a person aspiring for liberation should initially conquer his mind, and thereafter, if his mind is attracted towards a higher or lower form of either a male or a female, he should meditate on that very form in order to attain instantaneous samgdhi. If the mind perceives any flaws in that form, then he should believe that form to be Brahma by thinking, 'The whole world is Brahma. ' Thinking in this manner, he should refute the perception of those flaws. In this way, to accept only the transcendental words regarding experiences from the scriptures is the understanding of an unholy person. Such a misunderstanding reflects the wicked nature of his mind, and, at the end of one's life, its result is consignment to the deep, dismal regions of narak and the cycle of births and deaths. \" Thereafter, Shuk Muni requested, \"Now please explain what understanding a holy person adopts from the sacred scriptures. \" Shriji Mahgriij answered, \"The answer to this question is given in the sacred scriptures themselves. Specifically, those desiring liberation should not meditate on - with the exception of Purushottam Niiriiyanany deities such as Shiv, Brahmi, etc. Instead, among all humans and deities, they should meditate only on the forms of Rim, Krishna, etc",

In reality, all forms of God's avatzrs have only two arms. However, for the sole reason of dismissing any similarity that a person lacking wisdom may perceive between God's form and other forms, they are often described as having four arms or eight arms. 6 \"Moreover, one should only meditate on the form of God that one has attained, not on the forms of the previous avatzrs.

Amidst this mass of light lies a large, ornate throne upon which presides the divine form of Shri Ngriiyan Purushottam Bhagwiin. Countless millions of muktas are seated around that throne and enjoy the darshan of God. I constantly see Him accompanied by the muktas. Moreover, that God is extremely luminous. At times when, due to this luminosity, I cannot see God with the assembly of muktas, I feel deeply hurt. Despite being able to constantly see this mass of divine light, I am not attracted by it; I experience profound bliss only from the darshan of God's form. This is My method of worship. 10 \"Moreover, I like the bhakti that the gopis had towards God. For this reason, I continuously observe people, and having seen the affection a lustful woman has for a man, or a lustful man has for a woman, I feel, 'It would be good to have such affection for God. ' Also, whenever I see someone having great affection for their son, or their money, I again feel, 'It would be good to have such affection towards God. ' That is why whenever I hear someone singing, I would either send someone to that person, or I would personally go there, and I would feel, 'What he is doing is very good.

I enjoy the company of only such a person. If a person is not like that, then I do not get along with him, even if he is staying close to Me. In fact, I feel an aversion towards him",

How, then, should one understand the fact that awareness is not present everywhere equally. \" Shriji MahPrPj answered, \"The sun pervades each and every object equally by its rays, but its light is seen according to the object before it. For example, pure sunlight is not experienced as intensely on stone or sand or in dirty water as it is on a floor made of glass or in clean water. Thus, just as one experiences a greater and lesser intensity in the sun's light, in the same way, even though the jiva resides equally in the indriyas, the antahkaran and the indriyas' organs, one experiences its power more intensely in the indriyas because of their purity. Just see, does one experience as much sensation in one's nose and ears as one does in one's eyes. Furthermore, the four antahkarans are even purer than the indriyas, and so the jiva's power can be experienced there even more intensely. In comparison, it is experienced to a lesser degree in the indriyas. Nevertheless, the jiva does pervade the entire body equally. \" Thereafter Brahmiinand Swami asked, \"Many see the jva to be like a star, or like the flame of an oil lamp, or like the flash from a firecracker. How should one understand these differences in experiences. \" Shriji Maharaj explained, \"Just as a person who has mastered akshividyz can see the jiva and the form of God therein with his eyes, one who has attained realisation through the indriyas sees the atma in a similar manner. For example, if there were a glass doll shaped in the form of a human - with all - of its limbs, hair and vessels made of glass and if it were filled with light, then the light would be seen only according to the size and shape of the tubes within; it would not be seen -.",

However, when a person's vision does become transcendent and one with his btmi, he no longer perceives the divisions of the different organs of the indriyas; instead, he realises the &mi7 as it truly is. Just as one who has attained the viewpoint of IkZsh does not perceive the other four bhuts, similarly, one with transcendental vision does not perceive differences in the jiva's light arising from its indriyas, their organs and presiding deities, and the antahkaran; instead, he realises the jiva precisely as it is. Conversely, one who perceives distinctions does not realise the jiva as it is. For example, from a group of people, someone saw the tail of a cow, someone else saw its mouth, someone saw its hoof, another saw its stomach, and yet another saw its udder. Whichever part of the cow was seen did, in fact, belong to the cow, yet no one saw the cow completely. But, because at least one part was seen, it can be said that the cow was actually seen. In the same manner, a person can be said to have seen the a'tml to the extent to which he has seen the light of the btmi through his indriyas or antahkaran.

So much so, that no one is capable of distinguishing between their light. Actually, though, they are absolutely distinct from each other, but no one is capable of seeing these distinctions.

They are Yoga, Slnkhya and VedHnta, i. , the Upanishads. I shall now explain the principles of each, so please listen. 12 'Those belonging to the Sinkhya philosophy propound the existence of 24 elements2 and believe Paramitmii to transcend them; that is, Paramitmi is the 25th element. However, they do not accept jiva and ishwar as being distinct from the elements. Their reasoning is that the elements cannot be sustained without the jiva, and so, the jva is conceived only as a form of the elements because of its close co-existence with them. As a result, they do not consider the jiva to be distinct. Also, just as they regard the jiva as a form of the elements, they regard the ishwarswho believe the brahmindsto be their true form - as a form of the 24 elements. In this manner, they conceive both jiva and ishwar among the 24 elements, and thus count them together with the 24 elements; they do not consider them as being distinct from the elements.

Thereafter, it cannot be transformed back into iron even by the piZrasmaniitself. Similarly, one who has realised the greatness ~f God cannot be made to fall from the holy feet of God even by God Himself. Could he, then, be made to fall by any other object? Of course not. 14 \"In addition to realising the greatness of God, such a person also deeply realises the greatness of the Sent who worships God. He feels, 'This Sant is truly great because he is a true devotee of the manifest form of God. ' Uddhav, for example, was very learned, but because he had understood the greatness of God, he did not become conceited due to his intelligence. On the contrary, he yearned for the dust from the feet of the gopis and thus asked to be reborn as a vine. The reason for this was that he had witnessed the gopis' profound love towards God, whom even the verses of the Vedas seek. How, then, can a person who realises the greatness of the Sant of God harbour any conceit before the Sant? Why could he not bow down to him? In actual fact, he would behave as a servant of a servant before the Sant. Even if the Sant were to repeatedly physically mistreat him, he would tolerate it and would believe, 'It is my great fortune that I am bearing the contempt of such a Sant. Besides, due to my przrabdha, I would have been forced to bear the abuses of my wife and children, my parents, and the king. I may even have had to eat the leaves of dodi and mothya. At least here, in the company of the Sant, I am fortunate enough to be able to observe the vow of non-taste. Due to my przrabdha, I may have been forced to wear tattered clothes or rags. At least here with the Sant I am fortunate enough to have a blanket to cover myself with",

Consider the following as an example: If the British Governor of Mumbai were seated in an assembly, and if at that time a poor man were to enter that assembly but was not given a seat or welcomed in anyway, would the poor man become angry with the Governor? Would he feel like swearing at the Governor? Not at all. Why? Because the poor man has realised the eminence of the British official; that is, 'He is the ruler of the land, and I am a mere pauper. ' Hence, he does not become upset. In the same manner, then, if a person has realised the greatness of the Sant, then regardless of how much the Sant scorns him, he would never become upset with the Sant. In fact, if he does find a fault in anyone, he would find it in himself, but in no way would he perceive a flaw in the Sant. Thus, he who has realised the greatness of God and the Sant has a firm foundation in Satsang.

Well, the answer is that God is characterised by eternal existence, consciousness and bliss, and possesses a form full of divine light. In every single pore of His body, there is light equivalent to millions and millions of suns. Moreover, that God is so handsome that He puts even millions of Kiimdevs to shame. He is the lord of countless millions of brahminds, the king of kings, the controller of all, the antaryimi of all, and extremely blissful. Before His bliss, the pleasure of seeing countless beautiful women pales into insignificance. In fact, before the bliss of the form of that God, the pleasures of the vishays of this realm and the higher realms pale into insignificance. Such is the form of God. That form always has two arms, but by His wish, He may appear to have four arms, or sometimes to have eight arms, or He may even be seen as having a thousand arms. 8 \"Furthermore, it is that very God who assumes the forms of Matsya, Kachchha, Variih, etc. , and the forms of Em,K rishna, etc. , for the purpose of fulfilling some task.

That God Himself assumes the forms of Matsya, Kachchha, etc. , possessing countless divine powers and boundless strength.

By hearing those scriptures, inference of their appearance allows us to visualise them as if having firsthand darshan; also, their intelligence can be inferred from their words. In the same manner, one hears from the PurHns, the Mahlbhlrat and other scriptures that God is the all-doerresponsible for the creation, sustenance and dissolution of this cosmos - and that He eternally has a form. If He did not have a form, He could not be called the all-doer. Furthermore, Aksharbrahma is the abode in which God resides. It is that God who has a divine form; who is luminous and blissful; and who, at the time of creation, gives a buddhi indriyas, a man and prins to the jivas that had been merged in miyg along with their ka'ran bodies at the time of dissolution. Why does He give these to the jivas? Well, He does so to enable them to indulge in the superior, intermediate and inferior types of vishays as well as for the purpose of attaining liberation. 5 \"God has created enjoyments and places of enjoyment for the sake of those jivas; but within that, the creation of the superior w'shays are for the purpose of alleviating the miseries of the inferior vishays. For example, a wealthy merchant may have had trees planted on both sides of a road to provide shade; he may have had water fountains constructed; he may also have had alms-houses and guest-houses constructed. He does all of this for the poor. Similarly, before God, Brahmii, Shiv, Indra and other deities are as poor as those paupers of '47 who boiled the fruits of pipal trees and then ate them. It is God who has created those superior w'shays for the happiness of BrahmH and the other deities, and for humans. Also, in the previous example, since the rich merchant builds amenities in the form of alms-houses, guest-houses, etc. , for the sake of the poor, it is obvious that compared to those, the luxuries in the merchant's own home must be far greater.

But the bliss that is in God Himself cannot be found anywhere else. Consider the following example: The light from this burning torch which falls a short distance away is not as intense as the light in the vicinity of the torch. Very far away, there is no light at all. In the same way, elsewhere there is only a little bliss, but absolute bliss is only available in the vicinity of God. The further one is distanced from God, the less bliss one experiences. Therefore, one who is an aspirant realises, The further away I am from God, the more miseries I will face, and ultimately I will become extremely miserable. On the other hand, even the slightest association with God will provide much bliss. Therefore, I wish to keep close association with God. By doing so, I shall experience the highest form of bliss. ' One who thinks in this manner, keeps a desire for the bliss of God and employs any means to maintain very close association with God can be called intelligent. \"Moreover, the happiness of humans exceeds the happiness of animals; and the happiness of a king exceeds that; and the happiness of deities exceeds that; and the happiness of Indra exceeds that; then Bruhaspati's happiness, then Brahmii's, then Vaikunth's.

Moreover, vish wa, ta&s and prigna would be considered equal to Vishnu, Brahml and Shiv respectively. Thus, those followers would worship the 26th element with such understanding. So, to remove this deficiency of equating jiva and ishwar, one should learn the following method of interpretation from a wise person: The five bhuts residing in the body of ishwar are known as mahibhuts, and those bhuts sustain the bodies of all jivas. On the other hand, the five bhuts in the body of the jiva are minor and are incapable of sustaining others. Also, the jiva possesses limited knowledge compared to isbwar, who is all-knowing. One should learn such a method of interpretation so that the jva and ish war are not understood to be equal to each other. If one has not done that and some adversary were to ask a question in a debate, then one would find it difficult to reply. As a result, one's own understanding would become confused. But if one has learnt such a method, then even if someone were to raise a question, one would not allow the jiva and ishwar to be considered as being equal to each other. Therefore, one should learn such a method of interpretation so that the jiva and ishwar do not seem to be equal, and one should listen to words to that effect. 6 \"Next, the drawback of the followers of the Siinkhya doctrine is that they consider Paramatma to be the 25th element, transcending the 24 elements. They consider the elements as being false and Paramiitml as being satya. If that were so, who would attain that Paramatma? After all, the jiva, who is the attainer, is not considered distinct from the elements. Therefore, to remove that deficiency, one should learn the following method of interpretation from a wise person: Jiva and ish war have been included with the elements because those 24 elements cannot exist without the jiva and ishwar, But in reality jiva and ishwar are distinct from those elements and do attain Paramiitmi. One should learn such a method of interpretation. If one has not done so, and an opponent in a debate were to ask a question, doubts would arise; i. , one would think, 'If the elements are truly false, then what is the purpose of prescribing the observance of dharma such as brahmacharya, etc. , and spiritual endeavours such as shravan,",

In this way, followers of SBnkhya should learn such methods of interpretation from a wise szdhu. \"Moreover, the followers of Yoga propound methods such as the following: Liberation is attained by meditating on the manifest form of the avatirs of God such as Matsya, Kachchha, Variih, Nrusinh, VBman, RBm, Krishna, etc. But the followers of Slnkhya accept methods which claim that liberation is attained when one fully realises the form of God, through experience, as described by the various Shruti scriptures - for example, as stated in: & & 3GllQf FiW BTi.

Therefore, they are all God; all possess a divine form; all are satya and worthy of being meditated on. Certain Vedic verses also support this fact: Td m'i, % d fkTii and '$3 % fSSi d m m: t'iii. Thus, an aspirant who follows that path of Yoga encounters no obstacles. Why? Because that path is easy and relies on the manifest form of God. Because of this, through that path even an ordinary person can attain liberation without any difficulty. 11 \"However, there is one drawback on that path: Prakruti- Purush, etc. , are thought of as being the components of the alltranscending Purushottam BhagwHn. That is, the following belief could develop: Prakruti-Purush are components of God, Indeed, all this [i. the whole universe] is Brahma [i. the form of God]. Chhtindogya Upanishad: 3. 1 There is nothing in this universe that is not the form of Brahma [i. Bruhadiranyaka Upanishad: 6. 19 iii Idam hi vishvam bhagavsn-ivetaro yato jagat-sthgna-nirodha-sambhvai hil Indeed, this universe is as if another form of Godwho is the cause of the creation, sustenance and dissolution of the world.

Therefore, such a misunderstanding should not be allowed to arise. 12 \"Also, one should understand, 'God is one and unparalleled, while others such as Prakruti-Purush, etc. , are His devotees and meditate on Him. ' That is why they are referred to as forms of God. Just as a great sZdhu who meditates on God is known as a form of God, in the same way Prakruti-Purush, etc. , are also forms of God. Moreover, Purushottam Shri Krishna - - who transcends everything Himself assumes the forms of Vlsudev, Sankarshan, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, and assumes the avatirs of RSm, Krishna, etc. Thus, He is worthy of being meditated on. ' If one has such an understanding, then that path of Yoga is absolutely free of obstacles and is the best path. 13 \"Now the drawback of the SZnkhya doctrine is that it claims, 'All that is grasped via the antahkaran and the indriyas is false, while all that is grasped through experience is satya. ' Thereby, they propound all forms as being false. But along with that, they also consider the forms of God that have manifested to liberate the jivas as being false. In fact, they also view the forms of Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Sankarshan as being false. They only accept Viisudev, who is nirgun.

On the other hand, one who is not intelligent only acknowledges his own virtues, but fails to realise his drawbacks; he feels himself to be as eminent as the Sanakiidik, and he views other eminent people to be inferior to himself. One who is intelligent, though, realises his own flaws; i. , he acknowledges the fact that I possess this many flaws. Then, maintaining an intense aversion towards those flaws, he eradicates them. Also, if a sgdhu were to speak to him about eradicating those flaws, he would accept that advice as beneficial. As a result, no flaws of egotism, jealousy, etc. , would remain in him. On the other hand, someone may appear to be very intelligent, but if he does not introspect over his own flaws, then his intelligence should be known to be merely worldly. Outwardly, that intelligence appears to be very sharp but he cannot be called intelligent; actually, he should be known to be an utter fool, and his intelligence is futile for attaining his own liberation. In camparison, someone else may possess only a little intelligence, but if, after realising his own flaws, he attempts to eradicate them, then even his limited intelligence is useful in attaining Iiberation.

Or if two men are talking to each other, looking at each other or casually touching each other, then that is also a different type of love. But if a man is looking at a woman, embracing her, listening to her talks, enjoying her fragrance, then the love and mental attraction he develops for her is such that that type of love does not develop between two men.

We have experienced the touch of deities, demons and humans, but we have not experienced the touch of God as our husband. Therefore, please grace us so that he becomes our husband. ' Thereupon, Brahml said, 'Perform austerities, God will become your husband. ' Subsequently, they performed intense austerities, after which Ashtiivakra Rishi and Nlrad Muni both became pleased and granted the following boon: 'God will become your husband.

That would be detrimental. Therefore, those enemies in the form of the five indriyas should be confined, and work in the form of bhakti to God should be extracted from them. For example, a king who has captured his enemy keeps him chained and extracts work from him; never does the king free him or trust him.

In the same way, if one trusts one's enemies in the form of the indriyas and frees them, not keeping them confined, they will definitely make one fall from the path of God. Therefore, they should never be trusted. 13 'Moreover, just as the British arrest a criminal and keep him standing in a witness box to question him, without freeing him or trusting him, in the same way, the indriyas and the antahkaran should be kept in a witness box and in chains in the form of the niyams of the five religious vows4, and then they should be made to offer bhakti to God.

Moreover, just as the people in Satya-yug can indulge in any object their mind desires, God also indulges in objects in the same manner, but He does not behave in any extraordinary way. Also, as the lifespan of humans in Tretii-yug is 10,000 years, when God is born in Treti-yug, He also lives for that many years. The lifespan in Dwspar-yug is 1,000 years, and humans possess the strength of 10,000 elephants; thus, God also possesses the same strength and has the same lifespan. When God is born in Kali-yug, He assumes the lifespan and strength of humans according to the norms of Kali-yug.

One who has developed a firm conviction of both of those forms through intense shravan and manan, never harbours doubts in any way; whereas one who lacks this type of understanding does harbour doubts in God. 12 \"When that God - who possesses a divine form - assumes a human body, He behaves with swabhivs similar to humans.

Despite this, no person has ever been convinced of his or her own liberation as a result of its darshan; i. , they do not believe, 'I have attained liberation.

He was wearing a white khes and had covered Himself with a white cotton cloth. He had also tied a white pigh around His head and was wearing a garland of white flowers. At that time, some of the paramhansas were singing devotional songs to the accompaniment of a jhznjh and mrudang, while munis as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him in an assembly. Shriji Maharaj then said to the paramhansas who were singing devotional songs, \"Please stop singing for the time being and conduct a question-answer session. \" Thereupon Muktinand Swimi bowed to Shriji MahtirGj with folded hands and asked, \"Maharij, what is the nature of infatuation. Also, by what means can infatuation be eliminated. \" After thinking for a short while, Shriji Mahirtij replied, \"It seems that a feeling of delusion which often appears in the mind is the very nature of infatuation. When infatuation intensifies in a person's heart, the delusion in his mind also intensifies. Thereafter, he loses all sense of discrimination of what should be done and what should not be done. 5 \"In fact, just today, I was thinking about the reason behind such infatuation developing. Last night, I awoke in the middle of the night and slept facing north. Upon seeing the Dhruv Star, the following thought arose: 'This is the northem Dhruv, but the scriptures also mention a southem Dhruv. Where could that be. Thereafter, I looked for the southem Dhruv and I saw it as well. Just as there is a pulley for drawing water from a well, I saw a similar large pulley between the two Dhruv stars.",

I also saw the sun and the moon rise and set from the same direction. Then looking within, I saw that all things that are in the brahmznd- Dhruv, etc. - are also all in the body. I saw the kshetragna that resides in the body. I also saw Purushottam BhagwIn, who resides within that kshetragna. On seeing that God, My vrutti became deeply engrossed in His formso much so that returning out of samgdhi seemed impossible. But then, a devotee came near and prayed to Me. It was only out of compassion that I was able to return into this body. 6 \"Then, the following thought arose in My mind: 'I was able to return from samgdhi due to compassion, but what could be the reason for others coming out of samZdh~. It seemed to Me that they come out of samgdhi because attachment for some vishays still remains. 7 \"Therefore, the panchvishays are the cause of infatuation. Moreover, there are three grades of those vishayssuperior, average and inferior. Of these, if a person who has obtained superior vishays encounters someone who obstructs him from them, then that person becomes angry on the latter. From that anger, infatuation develops. 8 \"Generally, the ears have a constant relationship with sounds. The skin has a constant relationship with touch. In this way, the five gngn-indriyas are related to the vishays. Therefore, if a person who has casually seen an object wishes to break his vruttifrom that object and keep it focused on the form of God instead, then no effort is required; his vrutti would become detached quite easily from the vishays and remain on the form of God. On the other hand, if a person has seen an extremely charming object - such as a woman - and his vrutti has become fixed on that, then even if he attempts to keep his vrutti on God's form, it will not stay there. Nor will his chitt remain steady. Thus, as long as the chitt is attracted by alluring vishays, infatuation cannot be eradicated.",

Rather, it is those who have an intense yearning for liberation that keep such an inclination and offer bhaktito God. 12 \"However, the state in which one views pleasant and unpleasant vishays as equal in such a manner and becomes free of infatuation cannot be attained in just one day. Such an achievement cannot be accomplished so hastily; only one who attempts to do so gradually and earnestly accomplishes it. Take, for example, a stone placed on the edge of a well. Due to the constant drawing of water with a rope, after a long period of time the rope causes a groove to form in the stone, despite the rope being soft. On the other hand, even if an iron chain were to be used to draw the water, such a groove would not form immediately. Therefore, those who wish to strive for liberation should eradicate attachment to the vishays. They should not become frustrated or upset. This is also mentioned in the Gitl: d. ~m il ~iabl~tih~~Wc. h ii \"Thus, one should think, 'I will eradicate as much attachment to the wkhays as is possible in this life, and if in the process, some attachment still remains, then it can be eradicated in a future life. Moreover, since I am a devotee of God, 1 do not desire to enter the cycle of births and deaths.

When there is a deficiency in realising God's greatness, it suggests that there is also a corresponding deficiency in one's conviction of God. So, if one realises the greatness of God and has shraddha' as well, then one will be able to constantly contemplate upon God. \"Furthermore, God's greatness should be realised as follows: God, who transcends Prakruti-Purush, is the very same when He enters them; that is to say, He still retains His divine powers. Even after He enters the entities evolved from Prakruti-Purush, i. , the brahmtlnd, He retains the very same powers; but, in no way do traces of mZyi affect God's form. For example, consider the difference between gold and other metals. When they are buried together in the ground, after a long period of time, the metals other than the gold will decompose into the dirt surrounding them. In comparison, the longer the gold stays in the ground, the more valuable it becomes; i. , it does not decompose in any way. Similarly, God, deities such as Brahma and others, or other munis are not all the same. This is because when they come into the contact of dirt in the form of the wshays, then all except God become engrossed in those.",

If one realises such greatness, one would be able to constantly contemplate upon God. 16 \"However, as long as a devotee is attracted to vishays, he has not realised God's transcendental greatness at all. For example, Shri Krishna Bhagwan said to Uddhaj i, '0 Uddhav. You are not even slightly lesser than me. ' Why was this so. Because Uddhaj i had realised God's transcendental greatness and thus was not allured by the panchn'shays. 17 \"For one who realises the greatness of God, to rule a kingdom or to have to beg for food are both equivalent. He also feels the same towards a young girl, a 16-year-old girl, and an 80-year-old woman. In fact, he views all of the attractive and repulsive objects in this world as being equal; he does not get enticed by an alluring object as a moth does by a lamp. In fact, he is not tempted by any object whatsoever except for God; he is only attracted to the form of God.

Therefore, when observing the fast of Ekldashi, the eleven inndryas should not be allowed their respective diets.

By continuously making such offerings, Parabrahma Shri Purushottam manifests Himself within the brahmaswarup self of the person who performs such a 'yogayagna', just as God grants darshan to the performer of a traditional sacrifice. In fact, this is the fruit of the 'yoga-yagna'.",

That is the understanding of fools. \"In comparison, a devotee possessing gnZn realises, 'Only God is nirgun, and all those who have some relation to God are followers of the nirgun path. Furthermore, any spiritual discourse or devotional song associated with God is also considered nirgun. Others, which are not associated with God, possess mIyik gunas and should thus be considered to be sagun.

Therefore, one should realise the manifest God that one has attained to forever possess a divine form and to be the 'avatlri', the cause of all of the avatirs.

In reality, though, God is not formless. Because it is through God that everything mobile and immobile is created. Now, if God were formless, then how could He create something that possesses a form. For example, 5ktish is formless. Therefore, pots and other forms that can be created from pruthvi cannot be created from that iikzsh. In the same manner, since Brahml and the rest of creation possess a form, God, their creator, also definitely possesses a form. 3 'Noreover, the Shrimad BhPgwat states: 'The supporter of adhyiStma, adhibhut and adhidev is God.

Moreover, when Agni suffered from indigestion\", he came to Krishna and Arjun in his personified form. Then, when he went to burn the Khlndav forest of Indra, that same Agni assumed the form of flames and spread throughout the whole forest. In the same way, Purushottam Bhagwan pervades all through His antaryimi powers, which are brahmarup. Yet, possessing a definite form, He is also distinct from all. Brahmaiii itself is a ray of the light of Purushottam Bhagwan, while God Himself always possesses a form. Therefore, a person who aspires to attain liberation should realise God to possess a definite form and should maintain His firm refuge. 5 \"Moreover, he should speak in such a manner so as not to break someone's refuge of God. For example, just as a woman who carries a foetus in her womb attains a child, one who carries a foetus in the form of faith in God, attains God's Akshardhlm.

So Shriji Mahbrgj said, \"Here, I shall answer that question, and I shall also describe the characteristics of gngn, vairigya and bhaktiin turn. 9 \"All people have a tendency such that on seeing an enticing object, their affection for any object that is not as enticing will naturally diminish. Thus, before the bliss of God's Akshardhbm, these worldly pleasures seem artificial; permanent bliss can only be found in the abode of God. Therefore, if while listening to talks about God, the bliss related to God is realised, then everything that has evolved from mdyri will appear worthless. For example, a man with a copper coin in his hand will lose affection for it when someone offers him a gold coin in exchange. In the same way, when one realises the bliss related to God, one develops vairigya towards all worldly pleasures, and one develops love only for the form of God. That is the form of vairzgya. 10 \"Now I shall describe the form of gnin. There are two sets of scriptures that explain gnrin: One set is the Slnkhya scriptures, and the other set is the Yoga scriptures. 11 \"Of these, the doctrine of the Slnkhya scriptures is as follows: Akish pervades pruthvi, jal, tej and viyu, and there is not even a single anu that is devoid of ZkPsh; still the shortcomings of pruthe jal, etc. , do not affect EkZsh at all. In the same manner as ZkZsh, no mZyik flaw can affect Purushottam Bhagwiin. This fact is mentioned in the Krishnatiipni Upanishad as follows: When Durvbsb Rishi came to Vrundbvan, Shri Krishna Bhagwiin told the gopis, 'Durviisii Rishi is hungry; so all of you take dishes of food and go to him.

To understand this is gnin according to the Sgnkhya doctrine. \"Now I shall explain the doctrine of the Yoga scriptures, so please listen. The doctrine of Yoga is that whoever wishes to meditate on God should first stabilise his vision. To stabilise the vision, it should first be fixed upon the form of God or some other object. Then, while staring at the same object, the vision becomes steady, and with it, the antahkaran also becomes steady. When the antahkaran becomes steady, God's form should be beheld in the heart. This would not be strenuous for the yogi who attempts to behold the form; in fact, he can behold it quite easily. However, if, from the beginning, a person does not stabilise his antahkaran through practice, then when he does meditate on God, many other types of disturbing thoughts arise and obstruct his path. 21 \"Thus the principle of the Yoga scriptures is as follows: The vrutti should first be stabilised through practice before it is attached to God.

These and other such actions of God appear to be human-like.

However, when God performs human-like actions, a true devotee still perceives divinity in them, but by no means does he perceive flaws in such actions of God. Having such understanding is known as having bhakti towards God. In fact, only such devotees earn the fruits mentioned in the above verse. 26 \"The gopis were devotees of God, and they never, in any way, perceived flaws in God. On the other hand, merely on listening to the talks about the gopis, King Parikshit perceived a flaw in God. Shukji then explained those flaws to be false by illustrating the powers of God. Therefore, bhakti in which one perceives all of the actions and incidents of God as being divine, as the gopis did, and never perceives a flaw by understanding them to be human-like, is very rare. In fact, it is not achieved by merely doing good deeds for one or two lives. Rather, only when the pure sanskiirs of many lives accumulate, does bhakti like that of the gopis develop.

Ma+-s:~ The meaning of this verse is as follows: If a person sees nonkarma, i. , pin, in the karmas performed by the devotees of God for the purpose of pleasing God; and he sees a non-believer who has adopted the path of nivrutti as drowned in karmas, Amayo yena bhootrinimj iyate yash-cha suwat/ Tad-evah yimayam dravyem na puniti chikitsitam / / Evam mnimk riyi-yogihi sarve sansruti-hetavaha / Ta evfitma-vinzshriyak alpante kalpitzhd pare / / Observer of Pious Vows [VyHs]. Does not that same [food, e. ghee] -w hich causes illness in beings - if purified and prescribed by a qualified doctor cure that illness. Similarly, then, if all of one's karmas - which [normally] cause one to pass through births and deathsare offered to God instead, those same karmas are destroyed [i. are no longer capable of causing births and deaths, but instead, lead to one's liberation].

He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of paramhansas as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him. Thereupon Shriji MahCir2ij said, \"I wish to talk to you, so please listen. In the discourse I am about to deliver, I shall describe only one spiritual endeavour for attaining liberation, but it is so powerful that all other spiritual endeavours are incorporated within it. It is as follows: \"The jiva, which resides in the body, feels, 'Lust, anger and other vicious natures are attached to my jiva. ' In this manner, depending on which of the vicious natures, i. , lust, anger, avarice, etc. , is predominant in a person, he believes his jiva to be full of that nature due to his association with it. But, in fact, not a single one of these vicious natures lies within the jiva; the jiva has merely believed itself to possess them out of its own foolishness. 4 \"Hence, he who wishes to attain the highest state of enlightenment should make an effort, but he should not relax or lose courage. Also, he should think, 'Just as the four antahkarans, the ten indriyas, and the five pra'ns reside in this body, similarly, I am the jivatma, and I also reside in this body.",

      "content": "However, I am greater than all of them, and I am their controller. ' But he should not think, 'I am insignificant, whereas the antahkarans and indriyas are strong. ' For example, if a king were to possess little or no intelligence, then even the members of his own family would not obey his orders. When the people in the village hear about this, no one in the village would obey his orders. Further, when the people throughout the kingdom hear about this, no one in the kingdom would obey his orders. As a result, the king would become depressed and powerless. He would sit idly and would not attempt to enforce his rule over anyone. 5 \"In this analogy, the king symbolises the jiva, the members of the household symbolise the antahkaran, and the people of the village and kingdom symbolise the indriyas. So, if the jiva becomes discouraged and relaxes its authority, then when it wishes to exercise its sovereignty over the antahkaran and orient it towards God, the antahkaran will not follow. Also, if it wishes to control the indriyas, even the indriyas will not comply. Then, even though the jiva is the king of the kingdom in the form of this body, it becomes helpless like a beggar. When a king becomes discouraged, his subjects who live in his kingdom assume power and do not allow him to exercise his authority at all. Likewise, in the kingdom of the jiva, - symbolised by this body, lust, anger and other vicious natures who are not the king - assume the kingship. Then, they do not allow the ji'va to exercise control. 6 \"Thus, he who aspires to attain liberation should never harbour such timidity and should employ whatever measures are necessary to force the indriyas and antahkaran to accept his authority - like a king who studies books about the art of ruling and then exercises authority over his kingdom, but is not subdued by his subjects. However, if the king did not know the art of ruling, the people would not obey his orders; rather, they would begin to beat him. Then, his country would become desolate, or he himself would behave miserably because no one would obey his rule. In this manner, not knowing the art of ruling results in two unfortunate consequences. Similarly, if the jiva were to attempt to rule the kingdom in the form of the body without understanding the art of ruling, then it would never become happy.",

Then, one should conquer one's mind by meditating on God's form. One should conquer one's ears by listening to discourses related to God, but one should not allow worldly talks to be heard by the ears. In the same manner, the skin should only be allowed to touch God and the devotees of God. The eyes should only be allowed to do darshan of God and His followers. The tongue should forever sing the praises of God and taste only the prasZd of God. The nose should only be allowed to smell the fragrance of flowers and other objects that have been consecrated by God. None of the indriyas should be allowed to follow the unrighteous path. When a person behaves in this manner, no one can overthrow his authority in the kingdom in the form of his body. D \"Only one who endeavours in this way and totally discards timidity is said to be walking on the path of liberation. This is an extremely great method for overcoming one's swabhivs. If this method of personal endeavour is practised vigilantly, then all spiritual endeavours for attaining liberation are incorporated within this one endeavour.

Whether someone praises Me or insults Me - both are the same to Me. Gold, silver, diamonds and refuse are all the same to Me.

In this manner, God's method of birth and death are not necessarily in accordance with the ways of this world. When you thoroughly realise God as such, you will encounter no obstacles on the path to liberation.

If, however, the ears are simply plugged, then naturally no sounds will be heard. Similarly, if one does not touch anything inappropriate, one automatically conquers touch. In the same way, if one does not look at anything improper, one automatically conquers sight. Also, when there is delicious food, if one mixes it together and adds water therein, and one controls one's diet, then the sense of taste will automatically be conquered. If one blocks one's nose when there is an alluring smell, one also automatically conquers the sense of smell. In this manner, the panchvishays can be conquered by observing niyams. However, if a person does not observe these niyams, then regardless of how intense his vaira'gya may be, or how much gna'n he may possess, he will not The term means The Upholder of Dharma.",

This is because when that devotee meditated on God, he used to look towards God and God used to look towards him as well. But God was aware of the vishays the devotee thought about and had affection for while meditating on Him. Thus, when the devotee leaves his body, God sends him to a realm full of the m'shays for which he had a passion. God also issues the following command to kg1 'You should not interfere in this devotee's indulgence in the vishays. ' As a result, that devotee remains in Devlok and enjoys those pleasures. Thereafter, when he returns to Mrutyulok, he attains liberation eventually after many lives. \" Akhandlnand Swiimi then asked another question: \"What are the characteristics of one who possesses intense shraddha. \" Shriji Mahirgj replied, \"Whenever a person who has intense shraddhi wants to engage in an activity related to - God such as going for the darshan of God, or listening to talks and discourses related to God, or performing His ma'nsi pujz, etc. , then to be able to do so, he would become very hasty in carrying out his bodily activities such as bathing, etc. Also, if I were to write a letter changing a particular religious vow, he would be eager to comply with it. In addition, even if he were a senior person, he would become as impatient as a child to have the darshan of God. One who has such characteristics should be known as one who possesses intense shraddha: 15 \"One who has such shraddhi is able to immediately conquer all of one's indriyas.

Similarly, the vruttis of the indriyas cannot be seen, but everyone realises that they surge towards the vishays. If a person deceitfully attempts to hide this, then realising him to be deceitful, others will condemn him all the more. Therefore, in no way can one conceal the acute cravings of one's indriyas to indulge in the vishays. \" Muktgnand Swami then asked, \"How can those acute cravings of the indriyas to indulge in the d a y s be eradicated. \" la Shriji MahHraj replied, \"The only means to eradicate the acuteness of the indriyas is to force the indriyas to observe the niyams for renunciants and householders as prescribed by God. The acuteness of the indriyas automatically diminishes as a result. When one does not allow the five indriyas, i. , the ears, the skin, the eyes, the tongue and the nose to wander, the diet of the indriyas becomes pure, after which the antahkaran becomes pure as well. Therefore, regardless of whether a person possesses intense vairdgya or not, if he conquers his indriyas and keeps them within the nlj. ams prescribed by God, he can conquer the desires for the vishays more thoroughly than one does so with intense vairdgya. Thus, one should firmly abide by the niyams prescribed by God. \" Again, Ahhandanand Swami asked, \"If one has weak shraddhi, how can it become stronger. \" Shriji Mahiriij replied, \"If one can realise the greatness of God then even if one has weak shraddhg it will grow stronger. For example, one would never be attracted to earthen utensils that are used for drinking water. However, if those utensils were made of gold then one would naturally be attracted to them.

For example, to serve her selfinterest; a woman will not notice any faults in her husband. This also applies to other householders who, if they have - intense self-interest in their relatives brother, nephew, son, - etc. do not notice their faults. In the same way, if one realises that God serves one's own self-interest; i. , God relieves His devotees of their sins and ignorance and grants them liberation, then one will never perceive flaws in God in any way. For example, when Shukji narrated the RBs-panchHdhyHyi, King Parikshit raised the following doubt: 'Why did God associate with other women. Shukji, however, did not have the slightest doubt. Even the gopis, with whom God engaged in amorous actions, did not doubt by thinking, 'If he is God, why does he behave like this. ' They did not entertain any such doubts. Moreover, when God went to the home of KubjB, he took Uddhavji along with him, yet Uddhavji did not have any doubts at all. Moreover, when Uddhavji was sent to Vraj, he still did not entertain any doubts on hearing the words of the gopis.

At that time, Prlgji Dave was reading a scripture before Him, and paramhansas as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him in an assembly. Thereupon Shriji Mahlrlj said, \"Having thought over it from all aspects, I have come to the conclusion that of all the socalled evil company in the world, the company which is worse than all others is that of those who do not have bhakti towards God, or the faith in their hearts that God loves His devotees, is the master of all, is the uplifter of the wretched, and is also the redeemer of sinners. Two such schools of thought are prevalent in this world that share these beliefs: one is that of the na'stiks, and the other is that of the shushka-Vedlntis. Both are extreme forms of evil company. Now, even if a person has committed the five grave sinslo, if he has faith in God, then at some time or another he will be redeemed. In fact, even if a person has committed the grave sins of killing a child, slaughtering a cow, killing a woman, etc. , then he too can be redeemed at some point in time. However, one who has come to accept either of these two sets of beliefs will never be redeemed. This is because such a person's understanding is contrary to that of the Vedas, the Shlstras and the Puriins. 3 \"Of the two, the nistiks believe that RBmchandraji and Shri Krishna Bhagwan were actually only kings; and because Shri Krishna killed demons and committed adultery, he has been consigned to the third narak. Thus, in no way do they consider Shri Krishna Bhagwiin, who is the redeemer of sinners and the uplifter of the wretched, as being God. Rather, they believe their liberation to be through karmas; that is, while performing karmas, when one attains keval-gnin, one becomes God. In this way, they believe that there are countless Gods. So, according to the belief of the nistiks, there is no one, beginningless God, by whose worship a jiva is released from the bondage of births and deaths.

Thinking this, they no longer have fear in committing sins. Moreover, they believe, 'We have attained the nirgun path, so we will not have to take birth again. ' However, the shushka-Vediintis do not examine their own understanding which implies that nirgun Brahma, which transgresses miyi, will also have to pass through births and deaths. This is because they claim that Brahma itself has assumed the form of all mobile and immobile objects. This means that just as a jiva has to undergo births and deaths, Brahma also has to undergo births and deaths.

Instead, they have only one desire - to capture the opponent's flag and ensure their own victory. 3 \"Now, in this example, the flag represents the abode of God, and the brave soldiers of the kings represent the staunch devotees of God.

' Neither of these two types of thoughts arises within their minds. Such devotees firmly believe, 'We want to attain the abode of God within this very lifetime; we do not want to become enticed by anything along the way.

FoIlowing the completion of the installation of Shri Narnlrlyandev, and after thousands of Brzhmins from AmdZv5d had been fed, I departed from there and spent the night in Jetalpur. There, I began to think, 'I want to forget all memories of all of those people and all of the activities that I saw. ' In doing this, My heart felt intense grief, and as a result, I became ill. From there, I then went to Dholkii, where I spent the night. Then, walking from DholkS with the same thought in mind, I reached the forest of Ganesh Dholkii near the village of Koth and spent the night there. I began to think so much that I forgot all about My body. While thinking, I forgot all of the activities, and dispelled all those thoughts in such a manner that it was as if I had not even - stayed at Lake Kinkariii, and as if there had been no festival no thoughts remained at all. \"After those worldly thoughts had subsided, I began to look within. I began to see transcendental wonders and also the pleasures of the deities. I began to see countless types of - celestial vehicles, celestial maidens, clothes and ornaments just as if I were seeing them here in Mrutyulok. In My heart, however, I did not like anything except God. Moreover, just as the panchvishays here appear to be insignificant to Me - with My mind never being tempted - in the same way, My mind was not tempted anywhere from Devlok all the way to Brahmalok. \"Seeing this, all of the deities began to praise Me, You truly are an EkZntik Bhakta of God; after all, your mind did not forsake God and become tempted elsewhere. ' On hearing their words, My heart gained a lot of courage. I then told My man, 'I know your true form. If you harbour a thought about any object other than God, I will crush you to pieces.

When all of those thoughts were dispelled, the illness that had arisen as a result of those thoughts also disappeared. Thus, one who is a devotee of God should behave in such a manner. \" In this way, Shriji MahHriij narrated His own experience for the sake of the liberation of His devotees, while in reality, He Himself is the manifest form of Shri Krishna Purushottam NirHyan. Shriji Maharaj then said, \"The Viisudev Miihiitmya describes the dharma of an ekhtik bhakta as follows: 'An eka'ntik bhakta does not believe his body to be his own true form; he believes himself to be chaitanya. He does bhakti of God while observing dharma, gnin and vaira'gya. Also, he maintains no desire for any object other than God. ' When he becomes such a stidhu by worshipping God in this way, then there is no greater status than that of a stidhu. For example, in a kingdom, the queen's authority is equal to that of the king. In the same way, that sidhu possesses as much majesty as God. Therefore, a sidhu should not wish for the insignificant pleasures of worldly life. Because when that sgdhu attains the abode of God, then just as the lords of countless millions of brahmtinds- Brahml and other ishwarsbring countless types of gifts and other articles for God, they also bring them for that sgdhu. Moreover, by the grace of God, that sgdhu acquires transcendental powers and strength. Keeping such a lofty thought in one's mind, one should not desire anything other than God. For example, a person who has obtained a chinta'mani should look after it with great care. This is because it will enable him to obtain any object he desires. Similarly, a devotee of God should hold on to the chintgmaniin the form of God's form; he should never forsake it. Only then will he attain everything.",

Just as a person can die from heat or frost, similarly, when the mind travels towards the vishays via the indnyas, if those vishays are full of miseries, the mind becomes 'hot' like the heat of summer; and if those vishays are pleasurable, then the mind becomes 'cold' like the frost of winter. Specifically, when the mind, having indulged in those vishays which are full of misery and having become 'hot' like the scorching winds of summer heat, enters a person's heart, it makes the person extremely miserable and forces him to fall from the path of liberation. Such a person should be known to have died from the effects of heat.

Only one who has such an understanding can be called a full-fledged devotee of God. \"Moreover, no matter how great he may be, if a person perceives flaws in others and virtues in himself, he will certainly encounter hindrances on the path of liberation. For example, Riidhikiiji was great and she also had intense love for God; but when she perceived virtues in herself and flaws in Shri Krishna Bhagwan, a trace of tamogun entered into her love for him. Thereafter, she quarrelled with Shri Krishna Bhagwiin and ShridiimZi, and thus Shridiimii cursed her. As a result, Riidhikiiji fell from Golok, took birth in the home of a carpenter and had to marry a man other than God; thus, she suffered a severe disgrace. Even Shridiimii perceived virtues in himself and attributed faults to RBdhikiijT.

Moreover, regarding your nature, I know this much: Initially, you may become attached to any worldly object that you come across, but ultimately, you do not remain attached to it; you are capable of breaking that bondage. \" Thereafter, Muktanand Swami questioned, \"Why does the deficiency of becoming influenced in the first place still remain. \" Shriji Maharaj replied, \"Each of the eight factors of place, time, company, etc. 1, has a force equal to that of the past sanskh. Thus, when one encounters them, they overpower the force of the past sanskzrs. After all, if good deeds and bad deeds are performed only by the influence of one's sanskiirs then all of the distinctions of moral do's and don'ts; i. , 'This should be done and this should not be done,' as prescribed in the Vedas, the Shiistras and the Puriins, would become meaningless. But these scriptures, which have been written by the great, can never become false. s \"Just see, Jay and Vijay behaved improperly and thus fell from the abode of God, where there is no influence of &GI, karma or mzya'. On the other hand, Prahliid pleased Niiradji and thus, even though circumstances were adverse, they were unable to hinder him. Conversely, even though circumstances were favourable in Jay-Vijay's case, because the Sanakiidik were angered, Jay-Vijay fell from the abode of God. Therefore, one who wishes to attain liberation should do whatever pleases the great Purush. Such a Purush becomes pleased when there are no traces of impure desires left within one's heart. ID \"One should keep in mind, though, that one who harbours anger and other such vices towards the meek will also develop such feelings towards the great, and thereafter also towards one's Ishtadev. Thus, a person wishing to attain liberation should not harbour any vicious feelings towards anyone; if he does, then he is sure to develop such ill-feelings towards devotees of God, and then eventually towards God as well.",

In this sense, the mind is just like a ghost; when it is not engaged in the bhakti of God, it begins to conceive evil thoughts. This can be likened to the ghost getting ready to devour the man. For this reason, then, the mind should continuously be kept occupied in spiritual discourses, devotional songs, etc. , related to God. This can be known as having conquered the mind. 13 \"The second component is to keep the prZns under control. Shri Krishna BhagwIn has said in the Bhagwad Gitii, 'One's diet and activity should be kept regulated; that is, one should not keep a strong yearning for food. ' One who behaves in this manner is said to have kept his prZns under control. If this is not done, one will feel an intense yearning for food in one's mind. Consequently, one's tongue will hanker after the countless types of tastes. As result, any other indriyas that one may have conquered will also become unconstrained. Therefore, one should control one's prins by controlling one's diet. 14 \"The third component requires one to control one's body by physically keeping it within the niyams prescribed in Satsang for each individual. 15 'Thus, by strictly observing these three components in this manner, one's observance of the vow of non-lust becomes extremely firm. But one should not consider this to be very difficult to practise. Because it is not at all difficult for one who is, after all, a sidhu. The enemies of lust, anger, avarice, etc.",

Thus, when the jiva attains liberation, it would be distributed among all of them; moreover, all sins that are committed by the jiva would also be distributed among all of them. Therefore, the experiencer of pleasure and pain cannot be said to be just one jiva. Furthermore, the three types of karmassanchit karmas, prirabdha karmas and kriyamin karmascannot be said to apply to just one jva. Furthermore, in the past, when Niirad and the others became liberated, only their own jiva became liberated, but there is no mention of the jivas of the 24 elements becoming liberated as well. \" By using such logic, Shriji Maharaj proved the elements to be without a jiva. He then logically disproved each answer given by the paramhansas. As a result, the paramhansas were unable to answer the question in any way at all. Shriji Maharaj then said, \"Here, allow Me to answer the question. Due to the difference between an effect and its cause, there are two types of elements. The elements that are in the form of the cause are chaitanya, and the elements that are in the form of the effect are jad Now, in actuality, the jiva resides in the heart; but through its power of consciousness, it behaves with oneness with the body, indryas and antahkaran. As a result, the body, indriyas, etc. , appear to be chaitanya, but in reality they are jad. 8 \"When that jiva becomes a devotee of God and attains the abode of God, the elements which are jad are left behind. Now, as those 24 elements are produced from mIyi, they are forms of m1yI and are jaa\"; they appear differently in the form of the body, indriyas and antahkaran. For example, there is one pruthvi that assumes the five forms of the skin, flesh, marrow, bones and muscles. Due to the ingenuity of the maker, it also comes in the form of glass.

Of these, the first is that if one's chitt has a tendency of becoming engrossed, then it would become engrossed in everything. So, just as it becomes engrossed in one's son, wife, etc. , it can also become engrossed in God. Thus, that is one method. 5 \"The second method is to be extremely brave. When a person with such bravery in his heart conceives some desirous thought other than that of God, then as he is a brave devotee, intense contemplation arises within, thus dispelling all such desirous thoughts. Thereby, he continuously engages his wutti on the form of God. 6 \"The third method is fear. If extreme fear of birth, death, nard and the cycle of births and deaths exists in a person's heart, he continuously engages his vrutti on the form of God due to fear. 7 \"The fourth method is vairzgya. A person with vairggya - through gnZn of the Sinkhya scriptures - realises his own atma to be distinct from the body, and except for that GtmC he realises all worldly objects to be asatya. Following this, he beholds Paramiitmii within his atma and continuously contemplates on Him. B \"With the exception of a person on whom God bestows His - - grace regarding which there is nothing to say people may attempt countless other means, but without resorting to these four methods, one will not be able to continuously engage one's vrutti on God. Of course, continuously engaging one's vrutti on God is an extremely difficult feat. It is only those whose good deeds from many many lives have ripened who are able to do so. For others, it is very difficult, indeed. \" Having thus described how to continuously engage one's vrutti on God's form, Shriji Maharaj added, \"In this world, everyone talks of mzyii.

At that time, an assembly of munis as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him. I Out of compassion, Shriji Mah5r5j then began to preach to His devotees, saying, \"Mihen a person who wishes to worship God receives an opportunity to serve God and His devotees, he should serve them considering it to be his extremely great fortune. Moreover, he should do so only with bhakti, for the - sake of pleasing God and for his own liberation not for the sake of receiving praise from others. 3 \"The nature of a person, however, is such that he only enjoys doing that which satisfies his vanity. Without that, he does not enjoy performing even bhaktiof God. For example, a dog takes a dry bone to an isolated place to chew on. As a result of the chewing, its mouth is abrader. and the bone becomes covered in blood. Then licking the bone, the dog becomes overjoyed. But little does the fool realise, 'The taste that I am enjoying is that of the blood from my own mouth. ' In the same way, even a devotee of God is unable to forsake the bone in the form of egotism. In fact, all of the spiritual endeavours he performs are governed by vanity; they are not performed for the sole purpose of pIeasing God, thinking of them as bhakti towards God. Moreover, even of the bhakti that he does offer to God, he does so only when it nourishes his pride, but not for the sole purpose of pleasing God.",

The distinction of sagun and nirgun applies only to Akshar. 4 \"The nirgun aspect of Akshar has an extremely subtle form, smaller than even an anu, while the sagun form is much larger than even the largest of objects. Countless millions of brahminds dwell like mere atoms in each and every hair of that Akshar. It is not that those brahminds become small compared to Akshar; they still remain encircled by the eight barrierss. Rather, it is because of the extreme vastness of Akshar that those brahminds appear so small. Take Mount Girngr as an example. Compared to Mount Meru, it appears to be extremely small. However, compared to Mount Lokilok, Mount Meru itself appears to be extremely small. In the same way, the brahmiinds remain exactly as they are, but in comparison to the extreme vastness of Akshar, they appear to be extremely small. This is why they are described as being like atoms. 6 \"Aksharbrahma itself is like the sun in the sense that when the sun rises, all ten directions' can be determined in relation to it. Akshardhim is like that; i. , above, below, on all four sides of that Aksharin fact, in all directionsare millions of brahmznds. 6 \"Moreover, God - Purushottam - forever remains present in that Akshardhim. His will always prevails. While remaining in Akshardhlm itself, He manifests in whatever form is required in whichever brahma'nd. For example, Shri Krishna Bhagwin had only one farm, yet during the riis episode he assumed as many forms as there were gopis. In the same way, Purushottam Bhagwiin manifests in whatever form is required in whichever brahmindwhile simultaneously dwelling in Akshardhim. Actually, He Himself forever dwells The ten directions are: (1) Uttar - North, (2) Ishiin - Northeast, (3) Puma - East, (4) Agni - Southeast, (5) Dakshin - South, (6) Nairutya - Southwest.

' So, the answer to this is that although there is only one particular rajogun, countless types of distinctions are created within it due to the influence of differing places, times, etc. Thus, it is not the case that there is one, certain type of reasik karma. Rather, the type of karma performed varies according to the factors of place, time, company and action. 6 \"Having said this, though, if one performs some karma which displeases the Sant of God or an avatZr of God, one will suffer miseries similar to those of Yampuri in this very body here in Mrutyuiok.

The mind of the person who is dying also becomes dejected from worldly life. In the same way, I also constantly feel as if death is imminent at this moment for Myself as well as for others. In fact, I constantly regard each and every worldly object to be perishable and insignificant. Never do I make any distinctions such as, 'This is a nice object, and this is a bad object.

Well, within it there are no hindrances either of mPy5 or the entities evolved from miyP, i. , the three gunas, the body, the indriyas and the antahkaran. Whatever hindrances do seem to be in the atma are, in fact, due to ignorance. But no hindrances of any form remain in one who has totally dispelled them through gnin and vaidgya.

If that is so, how can there be even the slightest trace of mSydin Paramiitmii Narfiyan Viisudev, who transcends the itma. ' For this reason then, the virtue of atma-realisation should be firmly cultivated so that in no way does one perceive any fault in God. 3 \"Then keeping one's thought in the midst of the light of the Ztm. 5, one should destroy anything that tries to disturb his behaving as the Ptmi For example, when a lizard comes near the light of an oil lamp, it kills any insect that comes near the light.

Just as a dog derives pleasure from taking a dry bone to some isolated place and then licking it, in the same way, a foolish person believes that there are pleasures in such miseries and thus develops affection for worthless objects. If a so-called devotee of God does have more affection for some object than he has for God, then he is nothing but a 'cat-like'' devotee. A true devotee of God, on the other hand, would definitely not hold anything dearer to him than God. \" Shriji MahIrij then said, \"A devotee of God who possesses gnin, vairaragya,b hakti and dharma realises, 'One who is brave and who walks boldly towards his enemy at the time of battle is indeed truly valiant.

One's sampradgy flourishes by these three factors. \" Shriji Mahirij then asked the same question to BrahmHnand Swami and Nitylnand Swami. They also gave the same reply.

A sampradzy flourishes by knowing the following: The purpose for which the Ishtadevof the sampradiy manifested on earth; and after manifesting, the various divine actions He performed, as well as the ways in which He behaved. Through His behaviour, dharma as well as the greatness of that Ishtadev is naturally revealed.

Due to this affection, then, the jiva becomes absolutely fulfilled. 4 \"Moreover, even if one's wife, son or other family members are unworthy, and even if they are immoral and vile, in no way would one perceive flaws in them.

Consequently, he would not attain liberation. \"Furthermore, the greatness of the Sant is indeed as much as I mentioned earlier. Yet, even after attaining God and His Sant, some people still harbour the doubt, Will I attain liberation or not. ' What can be the reason for this.

This can be realised by the fact that one never experiences disturbances that are occurring externally when one is dreaming, On the other hand, if a disturbance has penetrated into the chaitanya, it is experienced in all three states7. Therefore, because I do not experience any disturbances in My dreams, it can be inferred that no disturbances have affected My chaitanya in any way. 6 \"Having said this though, if a devotee of God encounters some sort of distressing hardship, it is not as if I do not realise it; I very much do feel it in My heart. Only a non-believer like Raghunlthdls would not feel it. For when Riimlnand Swami passed away, all of the satsangis began to cry, but Raghunlthdls was not at all grieved.

Firstly, the following are the attributes of one who has realised the itmi On one side there is the 5tmZ and on the other side is the horde of m5yZ- the body, the indriyas, the antahkaran, the three gunas, the panchvishays, etc. The thought that rests between the two is full of gnin. This thought remains steady, just as the tip of a flame remains steady in the absence of wind. It is this thought which prevents the body, indriyas and antahkaran from becoming one with the ItmZ In fact, even the thought itself does not become one with the ltmL 'When the jva attains this thought, its vruttis, which once reached all the way to Eshi, recede to reach only as far as Vartiil. When that thought is consolidated, the vruttis then recede from Vartiil to reach only as far as Gadhadi. Then, from reaching as far as Gadhadi, they recede and come into the vicinity of the body. From the body, the vruttis recede further and rest in the organs of the indriyas. From the organs of the indriyas, the indriyas' vruttis turn inward towards the antahkaran. Finally, the vruttis of the indriyas and antahkaran become absorbed in the ZtmL It is then that the jivak kiran body, which is full of worldly desires, is said to be destroyed. \"Furthermore, when this thought meets with the itmi, divine light is generated in the heart of the thinker, and he has the realisation of himself as being brahmarup. In addition, he also has the realisation of Parabrahma NBrHyan - who resides within that Brahmai. One who has this realisation feels, 'I am the itmi, and Paramiitmii eternally resides within me. ' Such a sustained state is the highest level of atmarealisation. \"Secondly, the inclination of a person who has fidelity should be like that of the gopis of Vraj. For example, from the day the gopis touched the holy feet of Shri Krishna BhagwBn, all of the pleasures of this world became like poison to them. In this way, if a faithful wife who has the inclination of fidelity sees a man who is as handsome as Indra, or who is like a deity Here 'Brahma' should be understood to mean 'brahmarupS tma'.",

This is the highest form of fidelity. Therefore, if one attaches one's vmttis to God just as a faithful wife does with her husband, one's mind would never become pleased upon seeing anyone else. 12 'Thirdly, a person who has an inclination of offering bhakti with servitude would like the darshan only of his Ishtadev, he would like to hear talks only about Him; he would like His Ishtadev's nature; and he would also prefer to stay only with Him. Nevertheless, even though he has such love, for the sake of serving his Ishtadevand earning His pleasure, he wishes day and night, 'If my Ishtadev were to command me, I would follow that command most happily. ' If his Ishtadev were to give a command that would force him to stay far away, he would stay there happily, but in no way would he be disheartened. In fact, he finds supreme bliss in following the command itself. This is the highest level of servitude. Today, GopHlHnand Swami and also Muktanand SwHmi have such an inclination of offering dhaktjwith servitude. 13 \"Among the devotees of God who possess one of these three inclinations, there exist three levelsthe highest, the intermediate and the lowest. Those who are not found in any one of these categories can only be called wretched. Thus, it is only proper to die after one has thoroughly cultivated one of the three inclinations; it is not appropriate to die if one has not completely developed any single one of the three. Instead, it would be better if a person lives five days longer to dispel his misunderstandings and consolidate at least one of these three inclinations, and die thereafter. \" Continuing, Shriji Maharaj added, \"The nature of the jiva is such that when a person is a householder, he would prefer to renounce worldly life; but once he has renounced, he harbours desires for the pleasures of worldly life once again. Such is the perverse nature of the jiva. Therefore, one who is a staunch devotee of God should worship God after discarding such a perverse nature as well as all of one's personal likes and dislikes.

But when one has the darshan of God and His Sant, all those miseries are expelled. Such is the greatness of God and His Bhakta. In actual fact, the Bhakta of God is indeed nothing but a form of Brahma.

For example, even if a person scolds his own family members out of affection, or if they happen to scold him, grudges still do not develop in their hearts. With devotees of God, one should behave in the same manner. On the other hand, if a person does develop a grudge with God or His devotees, I do not even like to look at him. In fact, My anger with such a person never subsides. Moreover, those in this world who commit the five.",

Even if he attains samidu' by God's wish, his doubts are never eradicated. No matter what he sees in samidhi, he always desires to see something new; never are the desires of his mind subdued. Even if such a person experiences sama'dhi, it is savikalp sams'dhk and even if he does not experience samidhi, it is still savikalp samzdhi. Therefore, such a person cannot be called a gunztit, ekzntik bhakta. One who does have the firm conviction of God, regardless of whether he has sama'dhi or not, can be said to have constant nim%rralp sama'dhi. \" This verse lists ten characteristics or topics of discussion by which the form of God can be realised: (1) sarg - creation from mahattattva to the five bhuts, etc. creation up to VirHt-Purush; (2) visargcreation by BrahmH; (3) sthiinsupremacy of God in battle, etc. ; (4) poshan - God's compassion in the form of His protecting of the world; (5) ooti - karma and visanri; (6) manvantar-kathH - dharma of Manu and the subsequent kings; (7) eeshHnukathH -incidents of the various avatim of God and His devotees; (8) nimdh - dwelling in a subtle form - within the various forms of Prakruti; (9) mukti renouncing the form of a deity or human and residing in His original form; (10) Hshray - God as the refuge of the creation, sustenance and dissolution of the cosmos.

' With this thought in mind, they eventually fought at Kurukshetra. Thereafter, those who won obviously benefited. Those who were killed in the battle, though, attained Devlok and obtained happiness greater than that of ruling over a kingdom. 8 \"Hence, regarding one who takes up a fight with his mind - if he wins, then he attains nirvi'kalp samidhi and becomes an ekgntik bhakta of God. But if he should lose to his mind, he falls from his spiritual endeavours. Then, maybe after one life or two lives or even after many lives, ultimately, he will become an ekintik bhakta; but his efforts will not have been in vain. 9 \"Thus, a person who is wise should definitely develop enmity towards his mind for the sake of his liberation. Thereby, if he conquers his mind, he is sure to benefit; but even if he is defeated by his mind, he will eventuaIly return to the path of realisation, which is also beneficial in the end.

Also, if someone does not accept the sovereignty of an emperor of the world, but instead accepts the sovereignty of one who is not even a king, then that man is known as a slanderer of the emperor. If one writes and distributes letters stating, 'Our king has no nose and ears; he has no hands or feet,' and thereby describes the king as being deformed even though he has a normal body, then he is also known as a slanderer of the king. Similarly, God is complete, with limbs, hands, feet, etc. There is not the slightest deformation in any of His limbs. He eternally possesses a definite form.

Then the Slnkhya scriptures prescribed the 24 elements2 and said that God is the 25th. The Echiwa of the Sinkhya philosophy, Kapil Muni, thought, 'The jiva behaves as if it is one with the three types of - bodies i. , sthul, sukshma and kiran - and it cannot remain separate from them. The ishwar also behaves as if it is one - with its adjuncts in the form of its three bodies w>Pt, sutritmi and avyikmtand it too cannot remain separate from them. ' Thus, the Slnkhya scriptures count jiva and ishwar amongst the 24 elements and claim Paramitmii to be the 25th. 8 \"The ichirya of the Yoga scriptures, Hiranyagarbh Rishi, propounds that there are 24 elements, and that jiva and ishwar are the 25th; but Paramitrnii is the 26th. 9 \"This is how the Sankhya scriptures and the Yoga scriptures described God's nature; still, 'no one attained realisation of the nature of God as He is.

' According to the Yoga doctrine it was inferred, 'Paramiitmii, who transcends jiva and ishwar, who themselves transcend the 24 elements, is satya. ' In this manner, through these two philosophies, the nature of God was realised by inference. However, is that God black or yellow? Is He tall or short? Does He possess a form, or is He formless? That was not realised. \"Thereafter, Viisudev Bhagwan himself composed the PanchrItra Tantra, in which he explained, 'In his own Akshardhim, Shri Krishna Purushottam Bhagwan eternally possesses a divine form.

He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Garlands of flowers had been placed around His neck, and tassels of flowers were also hanging from His pigh. At that time, an assembly of munis as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him. Thereupon Chimanrgvji asked, \"Maharaj, initially, at the time of dissolution, the jivas with their kiran bodies were absorbed within mzyi. Then, at the time of creation, the jivas attained their sthul and sukshma bodies. Also, a variety of life in the form of deities, humans, animals, etc. Was this due to karmas? Or was it due to God's wish? If we say that it was due to karmas, then that would prove the Jain doctrine to be true. On the other hand, if we say that it was due to God's wish, then it would suggest that God is biased and not compassionate. Therefore, please grace us by telling us how things really are. \" Shriji Mahlrlj said, 'You have not been able to ask the question properly. The two types of bodies, sthul and sukshma, are both intimately associated with the kEran body in the same way that a tree is intimately associated with its seed. That is why it is called the kimn body. This kgran body is a form of avidye it is without a beginning; and it retains its sanchit karmas.

But, in reality, this belief of those nistiks is wrong. Therefore, if someone claims that kilis the only influencing force, then he is not correct. Or if someone claims that karma is the only influencing force, then he is not correct. Or if someone claims that God's wish is the only influencing force, then even he is not correct. Rather, the scriptures would propound the predominance of whichever influence is predominant at that time; but that same influence should not be accepted for all situations. 5 'This is because after the world was created, in the first Satya-yug, everyone's wishes came true, all were Brihmins and a child would be born merely by wishing for one mentally, There was a kalpamzksh in every home, and all people worshipped only God. Then, with the advent of Tretii-yug, people's wishes were no longer fulfilled; only when one went and stood under a kalpavruksh did one's wishes become fulfilled. Only after touching a woman would a child be conceived. Thereafter, when Dwiipar-yug arrived, children were born only after intercourse with a woman. In this manner, the ways of Satya-yug and Tretl-yug are not to be found in all Satya-yugs and Treti-yugs; rather, they were found only in the first Satya-yug and the first Tretii-yug. 6 'Therefore, when there is the predominance of favourable kiI, it diminishes the power of the impure karmas of the jivas. Yet, when a terrible famine strikes, everyone suffers; or when there is a horrendous war, hundreds of thousands of people are killed at once. In these cases were everyone's favourable karmas suddenly exhausted at the same time? Instead, it is the intense power of unfavourable kg1 that overcomes the force of",

In this manner, when the influence of a strong kzl is prevalent, everything occurs due to kg]. So it is mentioned in the scriptures. \"However, when many people become eka'ntik bhaktas of God, then Satya-yug prevails even in Kali-yug.

Thus, in those instances, only God's influence is said to be prevalent, but neither kilnor karma is said to have any influence.

In the assembly, the devotees were talking about God amongst themselves wherein the topic arose that there are two types of people: godly and demonic. Of these, godly people always become devotees of God, whereas the demonic will always remain opposed to God. Thereupon Chimanriivji asked Shriji Maharaj a question: ''Maharaj, is there any possibility for a demonic person to become godly?\" Shriji MahHriij replied, \"A demonic person most certainly does not become godly. This is because he has a demonic disposition from birth. Should such a person happen to somehow enter the Satsang fellowship, he still does not lose his demonic disposition. Then, when he leaves his physical body after staying in Satsang, he is absorbed into Brahma and then emerges out again. Only after he does so countless times is his demonic nature destroyed; otherwise, it is not destroyed. \" Then Shobhiir2im Shhtri asked, \"Mahirij, what is God's anvay nature, and what is His vyatireknature?\" Shriji MahHriij explained, The principle of anvay-vyatirek is not that God has become half anvay within mPyI and half vyatinkfrom His abode; rather, God's form is such that He is anvay within miyI and yet, at the same time, He is vyatirek.

Finally, when the vrutti sheds the predominance of the five bhuts and becomes nirgun, it appears to be extremely radiant and assumes the form of God. 4 \"Therefore, one who tries to maintain his vrutti on God's form in this manner should remain perfectly pure. For example, when one wishes to offer puja to a deity, the deity accepts the puja only after one becomes as pure as the deity. Similarly, one who keeps his vrutti on God's form should, according to the method prescribed in the SBnkhya scriptures, realise his own self to be distinct from the three bodies - sthul, sukshma and kgran; and only after attaining Ztrni-realisation, should he fix his vrutti on God's form.

When He assumes an avatzr upon the earth as a king, He possesses the 39 characteristics of a kings, and when He assumes an avatzr upon the earth in the form of a sidhu, He possesses the 30 characteristics of a sidhull. 4 'When God appears in the form of a king, He is adept in - the 64 arts and skills'; the four methods of ruling reconciling with one's enemies, suppressing one's enemies, instigating divisions within one's enemies and punishing one's enemies - as well as the nine types of sentiments\", such amorousness, etc. However, when God appears in the form of a sa'dhu, he does not have these characteristics. When God is in the form of a king, then in times of calamity He may even take to hunting to survive. He may punish thieves by strangling them, and He may also keep many women in His household. But in the form of a sgdhu, God strictly follows a non-violent lifestyle; in fact, He would not even pluck a blade of green grass. Also, He would not touch even wooden statues of women or paintings of women. Thus, the behaviour of God in the form of a szidhu is not the same as that of God in the form of a king. 5 \"The 39 characteristics of God's avatirs in the form of a - - kings such as Shri Krishna, etc. are listed in the first canto The 64 types of arts and skills were a classical cunicu1um of sciences, arts, and skills of cultured living that a member of a royal household would be expected to know.

Through these arts and skills, God, when incarnated as a king, would have the behaviour and appearance no different from a king.

Shri Purushottam BhagwEn, whose form is forever divine, is seated in Akshardhlm, which is as luminous as countless millions of suns, moons, and flames of fire. That same God assumes the avatirs of RGm, Krishna, etc. , upon this earth for the sake of granting liberation to the jivas. Then, the jiva that develops firm faith in that God by profoundly associating with the Sant progresses spiritually day by day, just like the waxing moon on the second day of the bright half of the lunar month. As the sun's effect on the moon increases, the waxing moon continues increasing; finally, when Punam arrives, the moon becomes full. Similarly, before developing - total faith in God, the jiva is as dim as the new moon of Amas only as bright as a glow-worm. Then, as a person develops faith coupled with the knowledge of God's greatness, his jiva'tma' progresses and becomes like the full moon of Punam",

Therefore, some minor flaw in oneself will not really harm the jiva very much; but if one somehow. doubts the divine actions and incidents of God, or if one somehow develops dislike for God, then that jiva instantly falls from the path of liberation. Just as when the roots of a tree are cut, the tree automatically becomes dry, similarly, a jiva who in any way perceives faults in God can never stay without falling from the Satsang fellowship. 4 \"Moreover, one whose faith in God is weak, despite being in Satsang, still doubts, 'Who knows whether I will attain liberation or not? When I die, will I become a deity? Or will I become a king? Or will I become a ghost? One who does not have absolute faith in God has such doubts.

On Posh vadi 7, Samvat 1882 [30 January 18261, Swiimi Shri Sahajiinandji Maharaj was sitting on a cushion with a cylindrical pillow that had been placed on a wooden cot under the neem tree in the campus of the mandir of Shri Lakshminiiriyan in VartI1. He had donned all white clothes upon His body and was also wearing garlands of white flowers around His neck. In addition to this, a decorated umbrella with a golden, egg-shaped top-piece had been placed above His head. Shriji MahZriij sat adorned in such a beautiful manner, tossing a pomegranate fruit in His hand. At that time, an assembly of munis as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him. Thereupon Bhagubhii PiitidLr of Bhidran approached Shriji MahHriij, and asked, \"MahZrZij, how does samidhi actually occur?\" Shriji MahHriij replied, \"God assumes an avatgr in Bharatkhand for the liberation of /ivas. When He appears in the form of a king, he possesses the 39 attributes of a kings; and when he appears in the form of a sgdhu, such as Dattltreya or Kapil, he possesses the 30 attributes of a sZdhd1. By appearance, God's form appears similar to that of any human; however, it is an exceptionally divine form. For example, a magnetic rock appears similar to all of the other rocks on the earth; yet there is an intrinsic magical property in it - when a ship sails past a mountain of magnetic rock, then all of the iron nails of the ship are drawn towards the magnetic rock. Similarly, when a person does darshan of God's form with shraddhi, be it the form of a king or the form of a sidhu, his indriyas are drawn towards God. Then one attains samzdhi \"Upon having the darshan of Shri Krishna BhagwHn, all of the residents of Gokul attained samzdhi, and in that samzdhi, God showed them his own abode. In this manner, whenever there is an avatgr of God, then at that time, God's form definitely possesses certain magical properties. Moreover, all of the indriyas of anyone who does darshan of God with shraddhz are drawn towards God, and he instantly enters samPdhi",

So what is so surprising about this happening to a devotee of God?\" Thereafter, Muktanand Swami asked, \"It is generally said that Brahma pervades everywhere. But how can something that is pervasive be said to possess a form? Also, how can something that possesses a form be called pervasive? That is my question. \" Shriji Mahlrij replied, \"Brahma resides in only one place, but not everywhere. That Brahma is Shri Krishna Bhagwin; He is in all places while still residing in only one place. For example, when a person worships Surya, Surya grants the person a vision like his own. Then, that person can see as far as Surya's vision reaches. Also, a person who has attained yogic powers can hear people who may be thousands or millions of miles away as if they are speaking next to him. In fact, he is able to pick up an object that may be millions of miles away, even though his arms are the same size as any other human's. Similarly, when Shri Krishna Bhagwin wishes to give darshan somewhere, He gives His darshan there while still residing in one place. Even though He has only one form, He appears in countless forms. In fact, if a person who is a realised yogi has extraordinary powers such as long-distance hearing and longdistance vision, then what is so surprising about God also possessing such powers? \"So, even though the scriptures describe God as pervasive, He actually possesses a definite form. In those scriptures, He is described as pervasive in the sense that using His own powers, He gives His darshan to all while still residing in one place. But He is not pervasive in the sense of being formless like a'kish. So, in reality, God eternally possesses a form. It is that God with a definite form, who, while always residing in Akshardhim, appears in countless milIions of brahminds. \" Vachanimrut VartiI-13",

This is because he who has committed one of the five grave sins can be redeemed of the sin by seeking the refuge of the Satpurush; but there are no means to be redeemed for one who has maligned the Satpurush.

Shuk Muni replied, 'The seeds of lust and other such vices are burnt from one's heart only when one attains nim'kalp sama'dhiand when one realises the itma'. \" Hearing this, Shriji Maharaj raised a doubt: \"Did not Shiv, Brahml, Shrungi Rishi, Parlshar and Nlrad have nirvikalp samIdh~?A ll were overcome by lust. However, despite their attainment of nirvikap samIdhi, when the muttis of their indryas reverted outwards, they were overcome by lust, anger, etc. For this reason, what you have said cannot be the answer to the question. In fact, just as an enlightened person remains undisturbed in nirv'kaalp samidhi an unenlightened person also remains undisturbed in deep sleep. When the mttis of the indriyas revert outwards, both are disturbed by lust, anger, etc. Thus, there does not seem to be any distinction between the enlightened and the unenlightened.

Also, he realises himself to be the itme distinct from his body, his indriyas and his antahkaran. After this, there is no object that would be strong enough to seduce him. This is because he sees all worldly forms as worthless.

Of the two, the nature of affection is like honey; i. , it sticks everywhere. The nature of compassion is that one feels compassion towards everything. When Bharatji felt compassion for a deer, he had to take birth from the womb of a deer in his next life. Moreover, one who is compassionate undoubtedly develops affection towards those for whom one has compassion. 3 'There are two methods for eradicating compassion and affection: atma-realisation and vairiigya. realisation is such that nothing else can penetrate it. The nature of vairigya is that it shows all objects to be perishible. Therefore, through itmi-realisation and vairtigva, compassion and affection are destroyed. In addition, the influences of the sthul, sukshma and kiran bodies, as well as all other influences are destroyed, and then, only brahmasatti remains. But thereafter, does a devotee harbour compassion and affection for God and His devotees. That is the question. \" Muktinand Swimi, Shuk Muni, Nityinand Swiimi and other parambansas answered according to the extent of their understanding, however, none could give a satisfactory reply to Shriji Mahirij's question. So Shriji Mahiriij said, \"Here, allow Me to answer. The answer is that by gnin and vairBgya, the chaitanya is freed from the mSyik influences of the three bodies=, the three states7 and the three gunas. It is then characterised by pure existence, and not even the slightest trace of minx influence remains. Consider, for example, the analogy of an oil lamp's flame. Only when a wick-holder, some oil and a wick unite can the flame of an oil lamp be seen and recognised. But, when the combination of these three components is broken, the flame can no longer be seen by anyone, nor can it be recognised by anyone. Only when those components are combined is it seen and recognised. Similarly, when all mZpX influences are overcome by gnBn and vairagya, the jivitmz remains as pure brahmasatta: 6 \"Now, the jv5tmZ is imperceptible to the mind and speech, and it is not perceivable by any of the indriyas either.

Because he who has not gained control over his indriyas does not experience happiness anywhere. Even while engaged in bhakti towards God, when the indriyas are drawn towards the vishays, that devotee experiences extreme misery in his heart, Thus, only one who gains control over one's indriyas remains eternally happy. Furthermore, only one who has gained control over one's indriyas should be known to have vairagya and dharma. One who has not controlled one's indnyas should not be known to possess vairggya and dharma. Therefore, since a person who has vairagya and dharma has restraint over all of his indriyas, he is eternally happy.",

There, she places her feet on the edge of the well. On the one hand, she stays cautious of this, lest she falls into the well. However, her wutti is also fxed upon drawing water from the well. As another example, a man who has mounted a horse is aware of his feet in the horse's stirrups and is also aware of the reins in his hand.

Then, just as tuberculosis is never cured by any medicine, similarly, the demonic attitude of one who has perceived faults in God or His Bhakta is never eradicated from the perceiver's heart. On the other hand, one may have killed countless Brihmins; or one may have killed countless children; or one may have killed countless women; or one may have killed countless cows; or one may even have associated many times with the wife of one's gurunevertheless, at some time or other, one can be freed from these sins. In fact, the scriptures even describe'the methods to do so. But as for perceiving faults in God or His Bhakta, no scripture describes methods to be released from such a sin. Indeed, if one consumes poison, or falls into the ocean, or falls from a mountain, or is eaten by a demon, then one has to die only once. But one who maligns God or His Bhakta has to continuously die and be reborn for countless millions of years. 4 \"Also, in the worst case, a disease leads to the death of the body; or if an enemy is encountered, at most he destroys the body - but the jva is not destroyed.

This was not due to - prirabdha, nor was it due to God's grace it was only natural. Moreover, if one does not worship God, one will obtain countless females in whichever life form one is born in. This would not be due to the service or puja of some deity, or to the chanting of some mantra; because the opportunity of enjoying women and other pleasures is but natural. In fact, several times this jYva has become a deity, where it has enjoyed the pleasures of Devlok; many times it has become an emperor of the world and enjoyed countless pleasures on this earth.

In the same way, even if a demonic person has become a devotee of God, the moment his wishes are not fulfilled and he is even slightly disturbed, then compared to the service of the szdhus he had previously performed, he wouId malign them thousands of times more. Even then, his mind would not be content. \" Muktinand Swiirni thereupon asked, \"Maharaj, You said that a demonic person who becomes a devotee will remain in Satsang so long as his wishes are fulfilled; and if they are not fuxlled, he falls from Satsang. But what if he happens to die before falling from Satsang. WiIl he remain demonic, or will he become godly. \" Shriji Mahiriij replied, \"As long as that demonic person is good when he encounters death, he will become godly and, offering bhakti to God, will attain the highest state of enlightenment. \" Then Nrusinhgnand SwGmi asked, \"Of the nine types of bhakti, which is the best.",

Now, consider the following: When one is attracted to an object, it is called affection or desire. Then, if someone were to obstruct the gaining of any object for which one has affection, one would become angry on that person. This applies not only to humans; even animals express such anger. For example, a buffalo that is attached to a female buffalo out of lust will kill another buffalo that approaches the female; this behaviour is widely observed in all types of animals. In the same way, one with deep affection for God immediately becomes angry on any object that acts as an obstruction in that affection, and he immediately shuns that object. Therefore, one who has deep affection for God automatically develops vairigya as well as discretion. \" Again, Shivgnand Swiimi asked, \"Suppose there are two types of people, both of whom are intelligent.",

Only when bandages are applied to his wounds is he relieved of his pain, and only then is he able to sleep. In the same way, the jiva has been 'wounded' by the panchvishays due to the influence of unfavourable places, times, company and actions. Whichever of the nine types of bhaktirelieves the pain of these 'wounds' caused by the vishays and makes one oblivious of the vishays themselves, should be thought of as the application of a bandage to the 'wounds'. Also, that particular type of bhakti should be known to be one's inclination in worshipping God. 5 'Then, abiding by that particular inclination, ane should engage in minsipujii or the mental chanting of God's name. In fact, whatever one may do, one should do so within one's own particular inclination. One will benefit tremendously as a result of this. \"However, just as a wounded warrior experiences no peace until his wounds are bandaged, similarly, if one fails to recognise one's own particular inclination, one will not experience any happiness at all during worship, and the pain due to the 'wounds' inflicted by the vishays will not be relieved. Therefore, after recognising which of the nine types of bhakti causes his mind to be fixed on God and prevents him from indulging in any thoughts other than those of God, that devotee should realise, 'This is my particular inclination. ' Thereafter, he should keep that type of bhaktjpredominant. This method is a universal principle. \" Vachangmrut Gadhadii 111-15.",

The question is as follows: It does not take very long for a devotee of God to shun the company of a person who is full of flaws.

After all, one naturally develops affection for a virtuous person, regardless of whether he is one's own relative or not.

Therefore, how does a devotee of God prevent the development of affection for anyone other than God, regardless of how virtuous that person may be. That is the question. \" The senior szdhus answered according to their understanding but were unable to satisfactorily answer Shriji Maharaj's question. Shriji Maharaj then said, \"Here, allow Me to answer. The answer is as follows: A wife who observes the vow of fidelity, even if her husband is poor, ugly, ill or old, is not even slightly impressed in her mind on seeing other meneven if they happen to be rich, handsome or young. If she does happen to affectionately look at or laugh with other men, then' she loses her fidelity. If some guests were to come to the house of that faithful wife, she would offer them food and water.

He keeps affection only for the form that he has attained, and he acts according to His wishes only. If he does happen to respect others, it is only because of their association with his God. One who, like a faithful wife, has such faithful bhakti towards one's own Ishtadev, never develops affection on seeing others, however virtuous they may be. For example, Hanumiinji is a devotee of Shri Raghunithji. Following the avatar of Riim, there have been many other avata'rs of God, but Hanumiinji's bhakti has been like that of a woman who observers the vow of fidelity, as he has remained faithful to Riimchandraji only. This is why HanumHnji's bhakti is considered to be like that of a faithful wife. The bhakti of a devotee of God who has such fidelity can be said to be like that of a faithful wife. Conversely, if a person does not have such an inclination, his bhakti can be said to be like that of a prostitute.

After all, the same types of worldly desires which appear while awake spring forth in dreams as well. \" Then Nirlobhlnand Swhmi asked, \"Mahlrlj, many times objects that have never been seen or heard in the waking state spring forth in dreams.

Eventually, he reaches a stage where the desires that give rise to births and deaths no longer remain. For example, grains of rice that are three to four years old can be eaten, but if sown, would not grow. In the same manner, when the ingrained desires generated by karmas performed previously become deteriorated, they do not lead to further births and deaths. 8 \"However, one may ask, 'How does one recognise whether those ingrained desires have degenerated, or not. ' Well, consider the analogy of a duel between two men armed with shields and swords. As long as both can withstand each other, the strength of both appears to be equal. But the moment one retreats, he is said to have been defeated. Similarly, for a devotee of God, so long as thoughts related to God and those related to the wshays appear to be equal, he should realise his worldly desires to be more powerful.

But, it will remain standing only as long as someone holds it up; the moment one releases it, it will fall to the ground. Similarly, one who is free of worldly desires engages in activities only to the extent of the instructions given by God. Take, as another example, a person with a bow and arrow in hand. The bow bends as the person pulls back the string; when he releases the arrow, the bow becomes slack again. In the same way, a person free of worldly desires engages himself in activities only to the extent of God's wish, but never does he do anything which transgresses that. On the other hand, when a person with worldly desires engages in activities, he is unable to detach himself from those activities of his own accord; he is unable to do so even when God instructs him to do so.

The first is lust, and the second is affection for his relatives. In my eyes, one who possesses these two undesirable traits is like an animal. Of these two, I have an extreme repulsion for one who has excessive affection for one's relatives. 3 \"For this reason, then, a person who has renounced worldly life should not keep even the slightest amount of affection for his relatives. Because having affection for one's bodily relatives is a sin graver than the five grave sins'*. Therefore, a renunciant devotee of God should realise his own chaitanya to be distinct from both the body and the relatives of the body. He should believe, 'I am the a'tmg I have no relations at all with anyone. ' In fact, the relatives of this body should be considered together with the relatives of the 8. 4 million types of previous life forms3. If a person does try to understand the greatness of his relatives, knowing them to be satsangis, then since there is already some affection due to the fact that they are related, he develops more affection for them than he has for God and the devotees of God. Therefore, if a person does keep affection for one's relatives - towards whom affection is but natural - knowing them to be devotees of God, then his life becomes futile. 4 \"Moreover, it is also natural to develop affection for those who perform one's menial service, though they may not be one's relatives. So, one who is wise should not keep affection towards a person who is serving one, even if the person serving happens to be a devotee of God. For example, if a snake has released venom into a mixture of milk and sikar, the mixture also becomes poisonous. Similarly, out of his own self-interest, a person should not keep affection towards one who does his menial service, even if the person serving happens to be a devotee.

Therefore, allow Me to answer it. \" He then explained, \"Dharma is of two types: One is nivrutti dharma and the other is pravrutti dharma. In turn, these two types of dharma can either be related to God or not related to God. Of these two, the type of dharma that is related to God is the one that was adopted by Niirad, the Sanakiidik, Shukji, Dhruv, Prahlid, Ambrish, and other devotees. It is this dharma that is known as bhigwat dharma or ekintik dharma. In fact, this type of dharma is not different from bhakti they are both one. The type of dharma that the avatirs of God come to establish is this very same dharma. On the other hand, the dharma of one's caste and Zshram alone is extremely inferior compared to bhi'at dharma, because it is through bhggwat dharma that the jiva crosses God's mEyZ and attains the abode of Purushottam. Therefore, the eminence of bhzgwat dharma and bhaktjis the same, and the fruits of both are exactly the same as well. It is in this way that the greatness of bhakti and dharma are the same. In comparison, though, the dharma of one's caste and ashram on its own is extremely weak, and its fruits are also temporary. \" Shriji MahBrij then continued, \"I am of the opinion that even if I try to develop affection for anyone other than God and His ekintik bhaktas, I cannot do so. I also feel that My inclination is similar to that of Jadbharat, Shukdev, Dattgtreya and Rushabhdev Bhagwan. As a result, I also prefer to stay only in forests, mountains and jungles; I do not like to stay in large towns or cities. Such is My inherent nature. Despite this, I stay in the midst of thousands of people for the sake of God and His devotees. Nevertheless, I remain just as detached here as I would if I were living in the forests. But I do not stay amidst thousands of people out of any self-interest; it is for the sake of God and His devotees that I stay in the midst of people. In fact, no matter how much pravruttiI may have to engage Myself in for the sake of the devotees of God, I still consider it to be nimtti.",

But if that type of flaw appears in a devotee of God, one should not take note of that flaw. One should perceive flaws in a devotee only if he were to lapse in his observance of some major religious vow but not on account of some other minor flaw. 8 \"One should also not be pleased by defeating a devotee of God in arguments. On the contrary, one should derive pleasure in deliberately losing to him.

Because this Satsang is divine, and all these satsangis are exactly like God's attendants residing in Shwetdwip, Vaikunth and Golok. I, Myself, swear by God and the devotees of God that I realise these satsangis to be the same as the attendants of God residing in the divine, all-transcending Akshardhim. \"However, one whose gnin, vairigya, dharma and bhakti are not extremely firm will most certainly suffer a setback.

He was dressed entirely in white clothes. Tassels of white flowers were hanging from His pggh, and garlands of white flowers adorned His neck. At that time, some paramhansas were singing a Vishnupad to the accompaniment of a dukad and sarod& while other paramhansas as well as devotees from various pIaces had gathered before Him in an assembly. Shriji Mahirij was sitting in that assembly in an introspective mood. Then Shriji Mahirij said, 'The inclination of profound, loving bhakti in a devotee of God, as described in this devotional song, is the inclination of Jhiniibhiii, and it was the inclination of Parvatbhiii and Mulji as well. I was reflecting within and was thinking that there must also be others in the Satsang fellowship with the same inclination. One who cultivates this inclination of profound, loving bhakti loses all attachment to the panchwkhays and is able to maintain itrngrealisation without even having to try. ' Thereupon Muktanand Swami asked, \"Narsinh Mehti worshipped Shri Krishna Bhagwiin with a sense of intimacy, whereas many devotees of God such as NHrad and others worshipped God with a sense of servitude. Of these two types of devotees, whose bhaktishould be regarded as being better. \" Shriji Mahiriij replied, \"'I'he type of bhakti offered by Narsinh Mehtii, the gopis, Niirad, and the Sanakidik is not of two types; in reality, it is of one type. After all, the body - be it male or female - is worldly and perishable; but the jivHtmii, the worshipper, is neither male nor female - it is characterised by pure existence and consciousness. When it leaves its body and transmigrates to the abode of God, it assumes a form according to the wish of God. Or, depending upon the opportunity for service that arises there, that devotee assumes an appropriate form and serves God accordingly.",

Having become a devotee of God, if one commits sins and accumulates detrimental desires in Satsang itself while offering bhakG then those sins become ingrained in oneas if etched in iron. Moreover, a graver sin than associating with others' wives due to the influence of evil company is to look at a devotee of God lustfully while in Satsang. Therefore, one who wishes to develop deep attachment to God should not allow any type of sin to remain in his mind. Because female satsangi devotees are to be viewed as one's own mother, sister or daughter. They are the extremely vile sinners in this world who look at women of their own family lustfully. So, he who looks at devotees lustfully is a vile sinner and will never be released from that sin. That is why one who wishes to become an amorous devotee should become an amorous devotee after shunning this kind of sin. 6 \"Having said this, though, the gravest of all sins is perceiving faults in God and His devotees, because due to that fault-finding attitude, animosity is created towards them. Even if one has killed millions of cows, consumed alcohol and meat, and committed adultery with the wife of one's guru countless times, one can still be released from such sins at some time or other. But, a person who maligns God and His devotees will never be released from his sin. Then, if the maligner is a male, he will become a male demon; or if female, she will become a female demon. Then, even after countless lives, that person will never cease to be a demon and will never become a devotee of God. 7 \"Furthermore, one who has already maligned a devotee of God and whose maligning attitude has become established will under no circumstances be able to eradicate that attitude.

If one has a firm conviction of this gnin in one's heart, then the vairzgya that results is true vairigya. Apart from that, any other form of vairggya only superficially appears to be vairigya; in fact, there is no strength in it.

Therefore, a spiritual aspirant should develop vairigya towards the worldly nshays and become totally attached to the divine and blissful form of God. \" Shriji Maharaj then continued, \"If a devotee has an intense yearning to engage in the bhakti of God and to associate with the Sant, then regardless of any swabhiv that he may possess, he eradicates it and behaves according to the Sant's will and command. Even if that swabhiv is such that it has become bound to the chaitanya, one who has an intense desire to do satsang will eradicate it. \" With that, He narrated His own story: \"Initially, My nature was like that 0f. a renunciant, but because I had an intense yearning for the darshan of Shri Rlmlnand Swami, I lived according to Muktanand Swami's instructions, not according to My personal preferences. \" Thereafter Shriji MahHrij said, \"The details of the kind of obstinacy a devotee should and should not keep are as follows: One type of obstinacy is observing the vows of non-lust and other such vows; the other type of obstinacy is behaving with the feeling that one will be able to sleep only if one's place is here and not if it is elsewhere. The latter and other innumerable forms of obstinacy that are the result of trivial swabhtvs should not be considered the same as the former type of obstinacy.

But if the latter type of obstinacy, which is due to swabhtvs, is formed, it should be thought of as worthless; and if the Sant asks one to abandon it, it should be abandoned. The former type of obstinacy, however, should not be abandoned. 6 \"To consider these two forms of obstinacy as equivalent is foolishness. For example, if a child has almonds in his fist, and if someone attempts to make him give them up, he will not. Furthermore, if he has a fist full of rupees or a fist full of gold coins, and if someone attempts to make him give them up, he will not give them up. Thus, it can be said that the child.",

Similarly, between the two types of obstinacy, one should realise which is significant and which is insignificant. If someone does not understand this and considers both to be equivalent, then he should be known to have a swabhiv of obstinacy and to be arrogant. If such a person does observe religious vows because of that obstinacy, and if he remains in the Satsang fellowship in this manner till the end, then it is all well and good; but one cannot have complete faith in him. Why? Because if he is offended by some remarks, or if his self-importance is not maintained, then he will not remain as he is. On the other hand, one who offers bhakti to God and observes religious vows with obstinacy is called a rijarshi. Even greater, one who offers bhakti to God while observing religious vows with the intention of pleasing God is called a brahmarshi and a sidhu. There is a similar difference in the fruits of the two as well. \" Continuing, Shriji Mahirij explained, \"Egotism, jealousy and angerthese three vicious natures are much more detrimental than even lust. Why? Because the Sant may have compassion on a lustful person, but he will not have compassion on an egotistical person. In addition, jealousy and anger are evolved from egotism. Therefore, egotism is a major vice. Furthermore, one does not fall from Satsang due to lust as one does due to egotism. For example, there are many householder devotees in our Satsangand they continue to remain in Satsang. So, I always have an intense aversion for these three: egotism, jealousy and anger. You will find this verified in My spoken words which have been written down. Also, if you reflect upon them, then you will realise this to be true as well. Therefore, one should eradicate egotism by realising the greatness of God. \" Again, Shriji Mahiriij said, \"What is the conviction of God? Well, consider how it is in worldly life.

Similarly, the attributes of the Santbeing free of lust, avarice, egotism, taste, attachment, etc. - are also described in the scriptures.

Their true bliss can only be experienced in sarngdhi or after one leaves the body; but it cannot be experienced by merely talking about it. For example, the pleasure of looking at an attractive object can only be enjoyed by the eyes. If someone were to praise that pleasure with his mouth by saying, 'I saw a very beautiful object,' then the pleasure experienced by the mouth is not the same as that experienced by the eyes. Similarly, one may attempt to praise with words the pleasure of sounds heard by the ears, fragrances smelt by the nose, sensations felt by the skin, and flavours tasted by the tongue, by saying, 'It was an extremely pleasant smell; it had a delicious taste; it felt very good; it sounded nice'- but one does not experience pleasure.",

What was that deficiency. Well, if someone wishes to indulge in savoury food due to a desire for tasting delicious food, and if God or the Sant denounce it, then he will suffer a setback. Or, if disturbing thoughts of lust still remain, and they speak against it; or if avarice remains, and if they have him renounce his avarice by telling him, 'Give away your wealth, property, land and farm to someone,' then he will be unable to follow this command. Consequently, he suffers a setback. Or if a person has egotism and the Sant denounces it and insults him, then he suffers a setback due to that as well. Therefore, a person suffers a setback due to the faults that still remain in him, even though he has the conviction of God. But if one eradicates one's faults at the outset - when one establishes one's conviction - then one will not suffer a setback. At present, if those who possess these faults thoughtfully introspect, they will be able to realise, 'I am weak in this aspect.

On the other hand, the householder will progress even if he has the darshan of a sidhu once every six months. Therefore, it is not appropriate for one who is deficient in vairdgya to renounce; it is only appropriate for someone who has intense vairigya. If someone who is deficient in vaira'gya does renounce, then his renunciation will not endure throughout his life. After one year, two years, or after even ten years, difficulties will definitely arise in his renunciation. \" Thereupon Shuk Muni raised a doubt. He questioned, 'Wahiriij, if the one whose vaira'gya is weak Iistens to the greatness of God from a sIdhu and ponders over it in his mind, then will he not develop intense vairigya. In fact, only very few peopledue to their prirabdhahave intense vairigya from the beginning. Generally, though, we see that a person develops vairPgya even though he did not possess it initially. How can this be accounted for. \" Shriji MahHriij explained, \"The answer to that is that one can never develop intense vairzgya merely by contemplating by oneself, or by any other means for that matter. However, if, in the same way that one has affection for God, one develops deep affection for the great Sant who possesses the four qualities of dharma, gnin, vairagya and bhakti, then all of the actions one performs - seeing, listening, talking, etc. - will be performed according to the wishes of that great Sant whom one has attained, i. , one will not do anything which is against the Santk wish. In one's mind, one constantly fears behaving.",

Therefore, if someone has developed such attachment for the Sant, then even if he does not have vairigya, his renunciation will endure till the end. 7 \"Just see in our Satsang fellowship, since all of the males, females and paramhansas are attached to Me, all the other females observe religious vows to the same extent as the two or three senior women. Because in their mind, they realise, 'If we do not remain alert and observe the religious vows, the love which Mahlrlj has for us will not remain, and He will become displeased. ' The paramhansas also behave in the same manner. In fact, it is the same for all of the other satsangis, brahmachiris and pzrsshads. All of the male and female devotees living far and wide are also alert in observing the religious vows; they too feel, 'If we do not behave properly, Mahlrlj will become displeased. ' Thus, all of them staunchly observe dharma out of affection for Me, even though they may possess vairigya to a greater or lesser degree. s \"However, when I recently fell ill in Panchiill, if something serious had happened to Me, then everyone's firmness would not have remained as it is now. At such a time, one who has intense vairigya can remain within dharma; or one who has affectionately attached one's Jva to a person who has intense vairggya can remain within dharma; or one who keeps contact with Satsang and, realising God to be antaryimi, behaves according to the niyams that have been prescribed for him can remain within dharma. Except for these, others cannot remain within dharma. Thus, what I have just explained is the only answer to the question I had asked.",

On the other hand, I do not like one who believes in and worships only the chaitanya divine light; nor do I like one who does not believe God to forever possess a form; nor do I like one who does not worship God.

The second thought is the constant awareness that even though death is certain, this much work has already been accomplished, and this much work is left, which I would like to complete. The third is the thought of whether or not desires for the panchv~shayhs ave been eradicated from My mind. In fact, I feel, 'If they have been eradicated, then why does activity regarding that vishay still occur? What if maybe they have not been eradicated? In this manner, I am constantly suspicious of the mind. The fourth is the concern of whether or not Muktanand Swami and the other senior sgdhus and senior devotees have eradicated their desires for the panchvishays.

After all, when one's diet is reduced, physical strength also diminishes. Only then can the indriyas be overcome; otherwise, they cannot. Having done that, if a person enthusiastically engages his mind in the nine types of bhakti of God, and himself Iovingly engages in bhakti, then he will remain in the Satsang fellowship till the end. But if he does not behave in this manner, he will surely succumb to his indriyas and, sooner or later, he will fall from Satsang. Even one who has mastered samidhi, like Govardhan, is afraid of this; so what can be said for others. 5 \"However, one's diet cannot be controlled by merely observing several fasts consecutively. That only leads to one's desires and diet increasing, because when one breaks a fast, one tends to eat twice as much. But if a person begins to reduce his diet gradually, it can be controlled. For example, even though the clouds cause rain to fall in tiny drops, water still collects in a large quantity. Similarly, one should control one's diet gradually.

He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of szdhus as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.

Please also describe what type of thoughts such a person has in his mind, as well as how he behaves physically. \" Thereupon Shriji Maharaj said in reply, \"If a devotee realises that only God is great, but he does not believe anything else to be greater than God; and if he also believes that everything except God is vain; and if he does not become disturbed or annoyed when God or the Sant attempts to forcefully alter his innate nature or when they do not allow him to behave according to his nature; and if he can forsake his nature, no matter how ingrained it may be, and follow the commands of God and the Sant in a straightforward manner - then that devotee's acceptance of the refuge of God will not falter, regardless of how adverse the circumstances may be. \" Shuk Muni then queried, \"Such a person must become disturbed, because when anyone's nature is forcefully altered, one naturally becomes disturbed. But the question is, are there differences in the types of disturbances that are experienced, or not. \" Shriji Maharaj explained, \"If a person is disturbed when his nature is forcefully altered, and if he then finds faults with himself rather than with God or the Sant, then he is good.

After all, how can one be sure of something that one has not experienced. \" Hearing this, Shriji Mahlrsj explained, \"One should reflect upon the thoughts that occur in one's mind. For example, 'In my mind, besides the thoughts of God, there are also thoughts related to the panchvishays; of these, for which objects do I have powerful desires and for which do I have strong cravings. If a person contemplates in this manner, he can realise himself as he truly is; otherwise, he cannot. During that contemplation, he should also realise, 'Ih ave very strong desires for this object, and I am striving to attain it. But, when the Sant attempts to have me forsake it, I will become disturbed. ' In this way, he becomes clear about his own self. If his nature is stubborn, and God or the Sant do not attempt to alter it, then he will survive in the Satsang fellowship; however, if they do attempt to alter it, then he will definitely fall. Ultimately, then, he will become extremely disturbed and will fall from Satsang. \" Thereafter Shriji Mahiriij said, \"The scriptures claim that to malign the Sant is the gravest of all sins. What is the reason for this. Well, it is because Shri Krishna Bhagwan himself resides in the heart of that Sant. Therefore, when one maligns the Sant, one maligns God as well. After all, when one maligns the Sant, God, who resides within his heart - is hurt. In such a case, the sin of maligning God is an even graver sin. Therefore, it is said that to malign the Santis the gravest of all sins. 9 \"Having said that though, Kansa, Shishupll, Putnl and other demons spited God, yet God still granted them liberation like that of a devotee. Because even though it was out of animosity, those demons did contemplate upon God. Therefore God felt, 'Those demons thought of Me and thus associated with Me, albeit out of animosity. So I should grant them liberation. ' These cases should be taken as examples of God's compassion. One should also realise, 'If God granted them liberation even though they sought the refuge of.",

However, one should behave only in a manner that will please God; one should engage in bhakti and please Him and His Bhakta. That is the way of devotees of God. \" Shuk Muni then asked further, \"Mah5riij, what are the characteristics of a Sant who is such that by maligning him, God residing within his heart is also maligned, and by serving him, God is served?\" Shriji Maharaj thought for a while 'and then answered out of compassion: \"First of all, the foremost characteristic is that he never believes God to be formless. He understands God to eternally possess a form and to be divine. In fact, no matter how many of the PurBns, Upanishads, Vedas, or other scriptures he may hear - if ever he comes across the idea of God being formless, he thinks, 'Either I have not understood the true meaning of the scriptures, or there may be some other purpose behind such words; but God indeed always possesses a form. ' If he does not understand God to possess a form, then his upa'sana' cannot be considered resolute, Besides, if God did not possess a form, then He could not be called the aH-doer - just as a'kdsh cannot be called the doer; nor could He be said to reside in one location. Thus God eternally possesses a form. In addition, He is the creator, sustainer and destroyer of countless brahmznds; He is forever present in His Akshardhiim; He is the lord of all; and He is manifest here before your eyes. The aforementioned Sant always has this understanding; but this understanding of his is never shaken in any way or under any circumstances. 13 \"Secondly, he engages himself in the ekiintjk bhaktiof God.

In this manner, he remains within the fellowship of devotees. 15 'Tourthly, when he comes across any precious item such as an expensive piece of clothing, some delicious food, clean water, etc. , he thinks, 'It would be nice to give this to a devotee of God.

There, He sat on a platform within the grounds. He was dressed entirely in white clothes. At that time, an assembly of paramhansas as well as devotees from various places had gathered before Him.

Also, what is the greatest obstacle in that endeavour for liberation, on account of which one would certainly fall from the path of liberation. Please answer both of these questions. \" Everyone answered according to their understanding, but the question was not answered satisfactorily. So then Shriji Mahlrgj said in reply, ''The most extraordinary spiritual endeavour for liberation is to understand Purushottam Bhagwin, who is seated amidst the mass of light of Brahma, as eternally having a form. Furthermore, understanding that all avatirs emanate from Him, one should accept the refuge of the manifest form of God by any means possible. One should also offer bhakti to that God while observing dharma, as well as associate with a Sant possessing such bhakti. That is the most extraordinary spiritual endeavour for liberation. One encounters no hindrances along that path. 5 \"A major obstacle in practising that spiritual endeavour is keeping the company of shushka-Vedgntis. Which obstacles arise when a person keeps their company. Well, initially, he develops affection for them. That affection develops due to the Vedlntis' goodwill.

Just see, a human is born of a human and an animal from an animal; a tree from a tree and an ant from an ant. Also, no matter how intelligent someone may be, no one is capable of replacing a destroyed part of someone's body exactly as it was before. God possesses innumerable such skills. Therefore, by realising such greatness of God and realising Him to be blissful, one develops vairggya for all things and love for God alone. 12 \"If one attains the gnZn of one's jivgtml and the gntin of God's greatness as mentioned earlier, then even if one has somehow become attached to any sort of pleasures of the panchvishays, one would not remain bound by them, but would, in fact, break that bondage and withdraw from them. How, then, can one who forsakes the pleasures of the panchvishays become attached. Therefore, having listened to these two types of gnh, one should apply them within one's mind with great fervour. For example, a brave and fierce man would be extremely angered if an adversary killed his father. If the adversary harassed him further by also killing his son and.",

Then, that gnan would assist him against any sort of adversity that may befall him. For example, when Hanumlnji brought the vishalyakarani herbal medicine for Riimchandra and gave it to him to drink, all of the arrows from Riimchandraji's body fell out by themselves. Similarly, all of the 'arrows' in the form of the indriyas'desires to indulge in the vishays are removed when these two points have been imbedded in a person's mind. That is to say, the mttis of his indriyas withdraw from the pleasures of the nkhays and become rooted only in God. Only he is a satsank because only he who associates with his own satya atma and satya God can be called a satsangi 13 \"If a godly person were to hear the talks of these two points, they would stir his heart and pervade every pore of his body. Conversely, if a demonic person were to hear them, they would not touch his heart at all; instead, they would exit from his ears, just as khir would not remain in a dog's stomach because the dog would vomit it out.

This phenomenon is explained in the Mahiibhirat through the story of Nrusinhji. When he wished to leave his body, Nrusinhji, through his antaryimipowers, inspired Shiv within his heart to take the form of a sharabh. Then both Nrusinhji and the sharabh fought a battle in which Nrusinhji died. Thus God independently, by His own wish, accepts a human body and abandons that human body. 4 \"After hearing the incidents of Rushabhdev being burnt in a forest fire, and Shri Krishna Bhagwin being killed by an arrow striking his foot, the minds of those with a nzstik perspective, and thbse who are not devotees of God become confused. They then allege that God too passes through birth and death just like themselves, and that He receives a human body according to His karmas and leaves the human body by His karmas as well. They also assert that only when God performs karmas that do not cause attachment will He be acquitted of His karmas and attain liberation. 6 \"On the other hand, those who have an Estik mind, and those who are devotees of God realise the understanding of the nistiks to be wrong. They know the body of God to be eternal; and that the birth, childhood, youth, old age and death of God, as well as whatever other bodily traits He may display, are merely an illusion. This is because ki'l and mZyi are not powerful enough to have any sort of influence on God's body. In fact, all transformations that do appear to occur in God's body are all due to His yogic powers. Those who are devotees of God do not become misled by this; whereas the minds of those who are not devotees become bewildered, just like worldly people become bewildered on seeing a wizard's acts. Those, however, who are aware of the wizard's techniques are not bewildered. Similarly, Purushottam Shri Narniirgyan also assumes many different bodies and discards them like the wizard.

Instead, they should form affection towards the Sant, the servant of God. They should accept this much. \"On the other hand, satsangis should renounce the sense of I-ness towards the body and develop an attitude of servitude towards God. If God or the Sant have become displeased in any way or have held one in contempt, then one should discard all ill feelings that one may have developed towards God or the Sant. Moreover, one should realise one's own mistake and accept the virtue of God and the Sant. In this way, one should always think positively, but never think negatively.

Under a large borsali tree within the garden, He was sitting facing east on a cushion with a cylindrical pillow placed on a decorated cot on a square platform.

Shriji Mahiirlj first thought for a while, and then said, \"Everyone please listen; I wish to speak to you. For devotees of God, there is nothing worse than harbouring impure desires. This is because devotees who have such impure desires, even if they stay near Me, cannot be happy. In fact, before engaging in the worship of God, they asked, 'Mahlrlj, please keep us near You.

Secondly, one should offer to God the nine types of bhakti coupled with knowledge of His greatness and the observance of dharma. As a result, God resides in one's heart and destroys the impure desires. In fact, just as God freed the elephant from the crocodile's mouth, in the same way, this method that I have just revealed to you will eradicate your impure desires. 6 \"Now I shall now tell you another method which will benefit all of you, so please listen. One should never intentionally infringe the codes of dharma related to one's five religious vows4. If one does so unknowingly, one should immediately atone for the infringement. 6 \"In addition, one should realise one's own self to be the witness; i. , 'I am the Ptm4 which is full of chaitanya; it transcends all thoughts and reason. This body, which is accompanied by the mind, is not actually my true form. ' \"Furthermore, if God smiles at someone, or if God calls someone, or if He performs any other sort of action, one should never bear an aversion towards Him. One should imbibe this form of understanding. However, someone may feel, 'I have worshipped MahBriij a lot, and I have also served Him a great deal; still, Maharaj does not talk to me. Instead, he talks to others a lot. So I might as well worship God while sitting at home. ' In this manner, he bears an aversion towards God. In that case, I could also believe, 'What does this person have to do with Me. As a result, that person's future would be uncertain. However, I Myself do not look at anyone's flaws. In fact, My nature is such that I always look only at people's virtues. 8 \"Now I shall tell you how that devotee should imbibe virtues and eradicate flaws. If he thinks, 'What was I like before I came into the Satsang felIowship. Well, I was the experiencer of kHI, karma, birth, death, and the cycle of births and deaths.

That in itself is bhakti. In fact, only by doing this does one attain God. That is why egotism, jealousy, lust, anger, avarice, etc. , are all obstacles on the path of liberation and should be discarded. 10 \"Of those vicious natures, egotism is absolutely the worst of all. Just look, one who has a minor flaw in any other religious vow still manages to survive in Satsang, whereas those who had egotism have never been able to survive. Therefore, sidhus. Never allow any lapse in the observance of nonegotism and other vows. Be extremely vigilant. Believe your self to be distinct from your body. Offer bhakti to Shri Purushottam, Shri NarniirByan, diligently and scrupulously. Constantly engage in worship coupled with remembrance of God; its bliss will equal the bliss of actually having the darshan of God. 11 \"Secondly, in our Satsang one who is well-versed in the scriptures is not necessarily great. Who should be considered great. Well, he who, through vairigya, considers all 14 realms to be as insignificant as a blade of grass; he who, just as he has firm attachment for his body, has firm conviction of God, i. , Purushottam, as He is; and he who is oblivious to the world in the waking state just as he is oblivious to the world in the state of deep sleep - such a person is great in our Satsang.",

Then addressing the entire assembly, Shriji Mahlrij said, \"In this realm, the jiva attains liberation only by the following means: faith in the manifest form of God, His darshan and His constant remembrance. After all, it is said in the Shrimad Bhagwat that even those who insulted God, namely Kansa, Shishupll, Dantvakra, etc. , attained liberation since all of them had constant remembrance of God. Thus, liberation is attained by constantly remembering God. And since all of you possess such remembrance, your liberation is assured. 3 \"Having said that though, you should still observe the codes of dharma prescribed by Me in all respects for as long as you have consciousness of your bodies. You may claim, though, 'If a person has attained God and constantly remembers Him, why does he need to observe religious vows. Well, in reply to that, consider the difference between one who firmly observes the vows and one who is slack in his observance. Allow Me to explain that difference to you. Even though both remember God, the person who does not observe niyams can only earn liberation for himself, but he cannot help other $vas attain liberation. Also, he does not become an ekintik bhakta, nor does he attain the nirgun abode of God. Although he does not have to undergo births and deaths, he cannot stay in the Satsang fellowship. \"All of you, however, are the best type of devotees. In fact, sidhus such as yourselves who observe niyams are of a totally different category. For that reason, whoever feeds you sincerely will earn the merits of performing millions of sacrifices and will ultimately attain liberation. Whoever touches your feet will be freed of their sins committed in millions of past lives. Anyone who kindly offers you clothes will also attain ultimate liberation. Whichever rivers and lakes into which you dip your feet become like places of pilgrimage, and any tree that you have sat under or eaten fruits of will also definitely benefit.",

That Shri NarnPriiyan Rishi is always present in your assembly. This is the answer to those two points. 5 \"If again you may claim, 'If we have a firm refuge of God, why do ma'yik gunas still pervade us. Then let Me say that it takes Me no time at all to eradicate the six physical and emotional sensations14 and the mi* gunas from all of you. In fact, it would take Me no time to enable all of you to recall your countless previous lives and to be able to perform the creation and other processes of countless brahminds.

Thereafter Ashjibh~ia sked Shriji MahHrij a question: ''Maharaj, how is it that one attains liberation by keeping enmity towards God. Please do tell us. \" Shriji MahgrHj replied, \"Once King Drupad wished to have his daughter, Draupadi, married. So that she could select a bridegroom, he arranged a grand function in which he invited all of the kings. DroniichZrya also came, as did the Pgndavs. Then all of the kings took turns to try and pierce the fish, but none were able to do so. Thereupon Yudhishthir said, 'I will pierce the fish. ' Having said this, Yudhishthir took aim. Drongchlrya asked him, 'Can you see this assembly. ' He replied, Yes, I can see it. ' Again Dron5chiirya asked him, 'Can you see your body. He replied, Yes, I can see it. ' Then Droniichiirya said, You will not be able to pierce the fish. ' In this way, four of the brothers were unable to pierce the fish.

In this manner, if 'all of one's vtuttis are focused on the form of God, then one can attain liberation even with a feeling of enmity towards God. 8 \"For example, when the vruttis of Shishupil, Kansa and others became completely engrossed in Shri Krishna, they attained liberation. But if a person does not know how to bear malice towards God in this manner then he is consigned to narak. Rather than this, it is much easier to engage in the bhaktiof God. Conversely, though, one who worships God with such a malignant intellect will never cease to be called demonic and can in no way be called a devotee. \"Thus, if one wants to forsake the evil practices of the demons and join the ranks of Dhruv, Prahlld, Nirad, the Sanakidik, etc. , engaging in the worship of God by offering bhaktiis far better. \" lo Having heard Shriji Maharaj speak in this manner, everyone in the assembly experienced profound bliss.",

If I will, 'May he lose his kingdom,' then his kingdom will be lost. If I will, 'Let there be this much rainfall here at this moment,' then it will definitely rain here; and if I will, 'Let there be no rainfall here,' then it will not rain here. Also if I will, 'May he attain wealth,' then he does so; and if I will, 'May he not attain wealth,' then he certainly does not.

Well, the explanation for all of his efforts not yielding fruits is that it occurs in direct proportion to his slackness in engaging in the worship of God. God definitely wishes to assist him. In fact, if His own devotee is to face the pain of a shuli God will reduce that pain by having him pricked by a mere thorn instead. As far as I am concerned, I feel, 'If a satsandis to suffer the pain of a scorpion sting, may I suffer that pain a thousand-fold instead, but a devotee should be relieved of that pain and remain happy.

Whoever has done this in the past, is presently doing so, or will do so in the future, should be regarded as one who has best utilised his invaluable human body, as one who has true understanding, and as one who is eminent. Conversely, one who does not understand this, wastes",

Even though the latter personwho may be called understanding, eminent and wise among the devotees - may be highly esteemed and famed in the world, his esteem and fame are merely like a dream. Those who assume such fame and esteem to be true and are infatuated by them, but do not understand the path to liberation, are called fools and selE destroyers by the Sant who is a knower of Brahma and by the sacred scriptures. They would then have to wait a great deal of time before receiving another human birth in such a place where liberation can be attained. 10 'The duration of this wait is stated in the scriptures. One lav of Brahmi is equal to our 666 years and eight months. Sixty such lavs equal one nimish, which is the equivalent of our 40,000 years. Sixty such nimishas equal one pal, which is the equivalent of our 2,400,000 years. Sixty such pals equal one ghadi which is 144,000,000 years of our years. Thirty such ghadis make a day of Brahmg, which is the equivalent of our 4,320,000,000 years. \"The passing of four yugs is called a 'chokdi'. Satya-yug lasts for 1,728,000 years; Tretl-yug for 1,296,000 years; Dwipar-yug for 864,000 years; and Kali-yug for 432,000 years. This means one 'chokdi' is completed in 4,320,000 years; and one thousand such 'chokdis' pass in one day of BrahmP. That is, in one day of Brahmii, 14 Manus and 14 Indras 'reign and ultimately die. Each Manu and each Indra reign for 308,571,428 years, six months, 26 days, 42 ghadis, 51 pals, nimishes and 42 and lavs. Fourteen such Manus and 12h4 Indras are created and destroyed during one day of Brahmii. Countless creatures die throughout that day of Brahmii. This is called nitya-pralay. 12 'When one night of Brahml passes and Brahmii retires to sleep, the ten realms inclusive of swarg, Mrutyulok and pZtZI are destroyed. Brahml's night is as long as his day. Thus, one of Brahml's night and day together lasts for our 8,640,000,000 years. The lower ten realms of the brahmznd are thus destroyed daily.

I have thus described the four types of dissolution. \"The third type of dissolution, prikrut-pralay, is the end of the lifespan of Brahmi.
